   Abstract
  </h6>
  <p class="ltx_p" id="id5.id1">
   A pivotal aim in contemporary AI research is to develop agents proficient in multi-agent coordination, enabling effective collaboration with both humans and other systems. Large Language Models (LLMs), with their notable ability to understand, generate, and interpret language in a human-like manner, stand out as promising candidates for the development of such agents. In this study, we build and assess the effectiveness of agents crafted using LLMs in various coordination scenarios. We introduce the LLM-Coordination (LLM-Co) Framework, specifically designed to enable LLMs to play coordination games. With the LLM-Co framework, we conduct our evaluation with three game environments and organize the evaluation into five aspects: Theory of Mind, Situated Reasoning, Sustained Coordination, Robustness to Partners, and Explicit Assistance. First, the evaluation of the Theory of Mind and Situated Reasoning reveals the capabilities of LLM to infer the partner’s intention and reason actions accordingly. Then, the evaluation around Sustained Coordination and Robustness to Partners further showcases the ability of LLMs to coordinate with an unknown partner in complex long-horizon tasks, outperforming Reinforcement Learning baselines. Lastly, to test Explicit Assistance, which refers to the ability of an agent to offer help proactively, we introduce two novel layouts into the Overcooked-AI benchmark, examining if agents can prioritize helping their partners, sacrificing time that could have been spent on their tasks. This research underscores the promising capabilities of LLMs in sophisticated coordination environments and reveals the potential of LLMs in building strong real-world agents for multi-agent coordination.

    Humans engage in various coordination tasks in their daily lives and work, including mundane activities like cooking and more important tasks like search and rescue. In order to assist humans with tedious or hazardous tasks, it is essential to create agents capable of coordinating with humans or other autonomous systems. Recently, agents based on Large Language Models have successfully demonstrated emergent problem-solving and task-completion capabilities in complex environments

    . In this work, we intend to find out how well Large Language Models can reason to solve tasks that require multi-agent coordination. Effective coordination requires agents to be able to infer their partner’s next actions

    In order to evaluate the multi-agent coordination abilities of LLMs, we adopt three different coordination games. The first game is Collab Escape, where two agents need to coordinate to escape from an adversary. The second is Collab Capture where two agents chase an adversary through a maze of rooms. The final game is the Overcooked

    , which requires two players to cook and deliver onion soups. To enable Large Language Models to understand and play these games we introduce the LLM-Coordination framework. The LLM-Co framework provides agents with contextual state information and feasible actions and interprets agent outputs for execution in real time. We will refer to agents using the LLM-Coordination framework as LLM-Co agents.

    In the evaluation, we first test the Theory of Mind (ToM) and Situated Reasoning abilities of LLMs, which are preliminary skills required for coordination. ToM allows models to infer the intentions and beliefs of others, while Situated Reasoning enables them to anchor these inferences in the contextual setting of the environment. We design the

    , including independent scenarios from our multi-agent coordination environments. The LLM-ToM-Reasoning Test Set requires the LLMs to reason about their partner’s intention and the current state of the environment to provide the optimal next action. We compare four different LLMs (GPT-4, GPT-3.5-turbo, Vicuna-33B, and Vicuna-13B)

    In order to evaluate sustained coordination abilities in LLM-Co agents, we use GPT-4 as the LLM of choice as it is the only candidate that provides acceptable ToM and Situated Reasoning skills. We compare the performance of LLM-Co Agents (w. GPT-4) with Reinforcement Learning (RL) based baselines, which are the gold standards for AI-AI gameplay. We also experiment with varying the partners in the Coordination Environment to proxy human agents to test the agent’s Robustness to Partners. We observe that LLM-Co agents perform better than or equal to the RL baseline in both AI-AI and AI-human proxy gameplay without any fine-tuning. Additionally, LLM agents have a further edge over RL methods due to their ability to fully explain the rationale behind their actions in free text.

    Finally, we study whether LLM-Co agents can proactively provide help to their partner (Explicit Assistance). We extend the existing layouts in the Overcooked-AI environment to involve a gate element that forces agents to assist their partners in order to complete deliveries. Through experiments on these new layouts, we discover that LLM-Co agents can determine the right strategy needed to help out their partners. However, they require a ”helper directive,” which uses natural language to prompt the LLM to be attentive to situations where their partner may need such help. We show that LLM-Co agents are able to outperform MARL baselines on these new layouts as well.

     Based on the popular Video Game ”Dead-by-Daylight”, Collaborative Escape involves two agents trying to escape an adversary in a maze of interconnected rooms. They need to fix two generators located in randomly selected rooms to open an exit portal. The adversary tries to catch the agents, and the win condition is any one agent escaping. This game requires strategies like luring the adversary away from the partner, sacrificing for the partner’s safety, and manipulating the movement of the adversary.

It requires agents to effectively navigate the layout and time their actions in response to their partners in order to increase efficiency. However, none of these environments elicit the need for agents to explicitly help out their partner sacrificing their own time.

     We intend to evaluate the LLM agent’s ability to make the choice to actively help its partner but also see if they can realize when the opportunity to help has arrived and take the right action to facilitate their partner. If the LLMs cannot make such a choice implicitly, we intend to see the effect of tuning the directives to bring about such a cooperative intention. To elicit situations that require one agent to drop their own cooking/delivery and help out their partners, we extend the Overcooked environment by introducing 2 new facilities (Gates, Walls) and 2 new layouts.

      , the Gated Delivery layout requires both agents to help out their partners during soup delivery. The two gates g0 and g1 make the delivery area inaccessible. Gates can be opened by an agent provided they are not holding anything in their hand. Once opened, a gate remains open for a very short time enough for an agent to move through it but not enough for an agent to open it in advance before picking up cooked soup for delivery. This necessitates an agent not holding cooked soup in their hand to go and open the gate for the delivery agent. The kitchen counters are replaced by walls to prevent the agents from taking the loophole of placing their soups temporarily on counters to open the gates. In this environment, both agents are equally placed, and they need to be acutely aware of their partner’s needs in order to complete even a single delivery.

      , the Locked environment is structurally similar to Soup Passing, except there is no shared counter to pass soup on. Instead, the agent in the left partition has to understand that their partner is locked behind a closed gate, holding a soup. In real-life scenarios, one collaborating partner might find themselves disadvantaged in a similar manner. In order to develop reliable assistive agents, the advantaged agent needs to understand the situation and make the choice to help out their partner since that provides a better common payoff.

    . Since LLMs struggle with grid-based reasoning and navigation, we provide relative distances from the agent to each location of interest in the state description. Along with player-specific variables, other salient state variables are also included as natural language descriptions. Finally, an agent is provided its partner’s inventory and relative position to allow it to consider their intentions. The state information provided to the LLM is equivalent to what a Reinforcement Learning agent would receive in the form of vectors.

      With the LLM-Co frameworks, we propose an LLM-ToM-Reasoning test set, which is a suite of 18 scenarios posed with questions among all three games: Collaborative Capture, Collaborative Escape, and Overcooked. The scenarios in pure-text are formed by the outputs of the State Description and Feasible Action Generator from the LLM-Co frameworks. The test set only includes scenarios hand-picked to represent pivotal situations that require the agent under-test to first take their partner’s possible next actions into active consideration, reason about the current state, and adjust their actions that ”indirectly” lead to the best possible outcome.
The same questions are shared across the test set which asks to analyze the current state, infer the partner’s potential next action, and predict the optimal next action from the perspective of a player.
We annotate the ground truth answers to the questions in the test set manually and ensure a 100% human success rate during the cross-validation process.

      We use the collected LLM-TOM-Reasoning test set to scrutinize the LLMs in the Theory Of Mind (ToM) and Situated Reasoning aspects, which respectively refer to the ability to understand the beliefs and intentions of other entities and the ability to contextualize this understanding within the environmental dynamics to formulate appropriate responses. LLMs under-test are required to solve the questions in the LLM-TOM-Reasoning test set, where the output answers to questions are manually compared against the ground truth.
First, we calculate the accuracy of the LLM predictions concerning their partner’s actions to indicate the ToM ability. Then, the accuracy of predictions for the next appropriate action and analysis of the current scenario shows the situated reasoning effectiveness.

     Sustained coordination refers to the ability of agents to continuously collaborate and adapt their actions over extended periods. Robustness to Partners is about an agent’s ability to adjust and adapt to interacting with new or unseen partners.
We use GPT-4 as the LLM of choice to test these aspects. The choice of LLM is dictated by the fact that only GPT-4 is able to display satisfactory reasoning that will be required consistently for Sustained Coordination. We evaluate the LLM-Co agent on 400 timesteps of gameplay in the Overcooked-AI environment. The evaluation metric used in Overcooked

      We pair two LLM-Co agents together to jointly coordinate and complete the cooking and delivery task in Overcooked-AI. This is analogous to testing agents trained with self-play methods being asked to jointly perform the task. We observe through visualizations of the gameplay that LLM-Co agents make effective use of all resources available to them to complete multiple deliveries effectively. In fact, without being trained or fine-tuned for the task, LLM-Co agents outperform or nearly match Self-Play baselines trained using Proximal Policy Optimization

For LLM-Co agents, the score obtained by agents for a fixed game description and directives remains the same as the agent always chooses to take the same medium-level action for a given state and history. This outcome is noteworthy because it demonstrates that Language Learning Models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4

Their actions are based on verbal reasoning, and they adapt to the current situation rather than adhering to a determined policy.

This understanding is crucial for the development of safer and more reliable agents, as well as for debugging when unexpected behaviors occur. The LLM-Co agent addresses this gap by generating medium-level actions and providing high-level reasoning for such a selection. This allows us to extract comprehensive insights into the decision-making processes under given conditions by examining the ”analysis” generated by the language model during gameplay. Using insights derived from this explainability, we report qualitative case studies in Appendix

      The LLM-Co agent, provided with the same prompt and directives as used in Overcooked-AI, struggles to recognize and help their partner agents in Locked and Gated Delivery environments. However, a simple directive informing the LLM-Co agent to ”help their partners when the situation demands” makes them actively look for opportunities to help their partners. We see that agents tend to help partner agents during the time they are waiting for their own soup to be cooked by choosing the open gates for the waiting agent. While this is not the most efficient strategy, which would have been to always help out a waiting agent, it still points to the agent’s ability to explicitly help out during coordination. Table

      Comparison of Gameplay on Overcooked-Assistance Layouts between RL baselines and LLM Agents. The RL baselines being able to effectively solve the deliveries indicates that the environments are solvable through self-play training. The high scores achieved by LLM agents demonstrate that LLM agents are capable of reasoning for providing explicit assistance to their partners.

      shows the performance of Self Play agents trained using PPO and PBT and compares it with the abilities of the LLM-Co agent provided with a helper directive. Since a reward is provided to both agents for delivery in Self Play training, we expected to see them gain the ability to open gates as it results in a reward after a short delay. In spite of this, the LLM-Co agent has the upper hand in their ability to deduce the right actions required to facilitate their partners.

    In this study, we evaluate the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models for achieving Multi-agent coordination. We evaluate LLMS across five aspects necessary for coordination through comprehensive evaluations in three different environments. We introduce The LLM-Co Framework for enabling Large Language Models to play multi-agent coordination games. We also curate the LLM-ToM-Reasoning dataset to assess the Theory of Mind inference and Situated Reasoning Abilities of Large Language Models. We show that LLM Agents are capable of Sustained Coordination in the Overcoked Environment and are Robust to the choice of partner. Finally, we introduce two new layouts to the Overcooked-AI environment and demonstrate the ability of Large Language Models to provide explicit assistance to their partners during coordination games.

     The constrained action set generator verifies the feasibility of performing an action before making it available to the LLM. This is a rule-based program that reduces the set of available actions. For example, It is not possible to pick up an onion or a plate if the agent is already holding an onion. In such a case, we will remove actions like

     This module is tasked with converting the high-level actions chosen by the Large Language Model (LLM) into specific, executable steps. Upon receiving a directive from the LLM, the module uses a Breadth-First Search algorithm to identify the shortest path to the target. The immediate next step along this path is then selected as the agent’s action for that moment.

     </em>
     . This directive would include both the sequence of movements needed to reach the target location and the final action to complete the task, like placing the onion. Once this directive is completed, control returns to the State Representation Module, which then consults the LLM for the next high-level action.

Since the soup is not cooked, the agent with a plate is just waiting near the cooker to load the soup onto the plate. However, this time could be used by the other agent to put an onion in the adjoining cooker. In this situation, the LLM-Co agent is able to realize that it needs to move away to enable its partner.

        There are two partitions in the current environment. Bob is in the left partition with access to onion dispenser (o0), delivery area (d0), plate dispenser (p0) and kitchen counters (k0, k1, k2, k3, k4, k11, k12, k16, k18, k20, k21, k22, k23). Alice is in the right partition and has access to onion dispenser (o1), delivery area (d1), plate dispenser (p1) and kitchen counters (k6, k7, k8, k9, k10, k14, k15, k17, k19, k25, k26, k27, k28). Both have access to both cookers (c0, c1). Kitchen counters (k0 to k28) can be used to temporarily store onions and plates while you do something else. Objects on counters can be picked up later and should be considered as they may be closer than items in dispensers.

        The environment is split into two partitions, one with each player. In the right partition, Alice has access to cookers (c0, c1), delivery area (d0) and kitchen counters (k6, k8, k12). In the left partition, Bob has access to onion dispensers (o0, o1), plate dispenser (p0) and kitchen counters (k1, k10). Kitchen counters can be used to temporarily store onions and plates while you do something else. Both players have access to shared counters (s0, s1, s2) which can be used to transfer onions and plates depending on the situation. Note that the objects on the shared counters can be accessed by both players. Objects on counters can be picked up later and should be considered as they may be closer than items in dispensers.

        The environment is rectangular with 2 onions dispensers (o0, o1), cooker (c0) and plate dispenser (p0). The delivery area (d0) is inaccessible behind closed gates and can be accessed by opening one of the gates (g0, g1). A gate can only be opened by a player if they are not carrying an object. Once the gate is opened it will only stay open for a brief time and then close on its own.

        The environment is divided into 2 partitions. Alice is in the left partition with access to onion dispenser o0, plate dispenser p1, cooker c0, and delivery area d0. Bob is in the right partition with access to onion dispenser o1, plate dispenser p0, and cooker c1. The two partitions are connected by gate g0 which can be opened if a player is holding nothing. Opening the gate will allow players to move freely between partitions. The gate will close after enough time automatically.
