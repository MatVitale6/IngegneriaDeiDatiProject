   Abstract
  </h6>
  <p class="ltx_p" id="id1.id1">
   Tremendous efforts have been devoted to automating software debugging, a time-consuming process involving fault localization and repair generation.
Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great potential in automated debugging.
However, we identified three challenges posed to traditional and LLM-based debugging tools: 1) the upstream imperfection of fault localization affects the downstream repair, 2) the deficiency in handling complex logic errors, and 3) the ignorance of program contexts.
In this context, we propose the first automated, unified debugging framework, FixAgent, via LLM agent synergy. FixAgent can perform end-to-end localization, repair, and analysis of bugs.
Our insight is that LLMs can benefit from general software engineering principles recognized by human developers in debugging, such as
   <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="id1.id1.1">
    rubber duck debugging
   </span>
   , enabling a better understanding of program functionality and logic bugs.
Hence, we create three designs inspired by rubber ducking to address these challenges. They are LLM agent specialization and synergy, key variable tracking, and program context comprehension, which request LLMs to provide explicit explanations and force them to focus on crucial program logic information.
Experiments on the widely used dataset QuixBugs show that FixAgent correctly fixes 79 out of 80 bugs, 9 of which have never been fixed.
It also plausibly patches 1.9X more defects than the best-performing repair tool on Codeflaws, even with no bug location information and fewer than 0.6% sampling times.
On average, FixAgent increases about 20% plausible and correct fixes compared to its base model using different LLMs, showing the effectiveness of our designs.
Moreover, the correctness rate of FixAgent reaches remarkably 97.26%, indicating that FixAgent can potentially overcome the overfitting issue of the existing approaches.

1)
    <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S1.p3.1.1">
     Imperfect fault localization
    </span>
    Previous studies assume off-the-shelf FL tools perfectly identify bug locations, so APR should only patch the suspicious code statements.
Yet, existing FL techniques show limited effectiveness in practice

    , they still struggle to repair complex logic errors, as debugging is a multi-step reasoning process, which is challenging for models that rely on pattern recognition rather than genuine thinking.
When the program structure is complex or poorly documented, LLMs may perform even worse than small models

     Context ignorance.
    </span>
    Debugging demands understanding both the purpose and the broader operational context of a program, including intended outcomes and potential side effects.
Most LLMs are trained on file-level source code, lacking the ability to analyze dependencies.
Plus, LLM-based APR considers the code and test outcomes only, ignoring the informative program contexts, such as variable scopes, function definitions, and external libraries, limiting the debugging capability of LLMs.

     LLMs closely mimic developers when performing coding-related tasks, so they can benefit from general software engineering principles.
    </span>
    We adopt the principle of rubber duck debugging (or rubber ducking), a debugging method where developers articulate their code in spoken natural languages, often line by line.
Inspired by rubber ducking, we propose
    <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="S1.p4.1.3">

    Specifically, we create three main designs to address the above challenges:
    <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S1.p5.1.1">
     1) Specialized agent synergy.
    </span>
    We first specialize two LLM agents to serve as a bug
    <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S1.p5.1.2">
     localizer
    </span>
    and program
    <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S1.p5.1.3">
     repairer
    </span>
    , respectively, to complete multi-stage debugging, followed by an extra LLM agent to analyze the bug-repair pair.
Each agent explains its work to a “rubber duck” in detail.
Their synergy delivers program repairs with explanations without any prior bug locations.
In addition, the repairer may correct the mistakes made by the localizer,
    <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S1.p5.1.4">
     i.e.
    </span>
    ,, patching code statements beyond those identified by the localizer. If a plausible patch is generated and the changed code elements are different from the localization, FixAgent will adjust the localization results.
Moreover, explaining to a rubber duck separately guides the agents in focusing on a specific task and better assists developers since over 85% of developers want to know the rationale behind automated debugging

    <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S1.p5.1.5">
     2) Intermediate variable tracking.
    </span>
    We prompt each agent to explicitly track key variables at critical points in the buggy program and discuss how such tracking guides their task completion.
This strategy forces agents to analyze the code along the logic execution paths and provide more bug-oriented explanations.
We do not require a line-by-line explanation as the original rubber ducking does because a buggy program (with its context) can be very long, which may degrade the performance of LLMs or even extend the window length that LLMs can handle

    <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S1.p5.1.6">
     3) Program context construction.
    </span>
    We construct the program context with respect to its specifications and dependencies.
The context is provided along with the buggy program to FixAgent.
Program specifications can include a functionality description, input/output format or examples, variable scopes, etc.
Afterward, we parse the dependencies between files inside a repository to align with real-world projects.
These two parts consist of the context.
We also encourage agents to analyze the buggy program against the given context to obtain more attention to the context.

    Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of FixAgent.
We compare FixAgent against 16 baselines, including 10 state-of-the-art APR tools and 6 base LLMs.
The comparison experiments are conducted on two widely used datasets, QuixBugs

    </cite>
    , written in three programming languages (C, Python, and Java).
Overall, FixAgent patches 2780 bugs (passing all test cases) out of 3982 defects on these two datasets, with an estimated correctness rate of 96.5% on average.
It outperforms all baselines significantly, even without any prior bug locations, whereas previous APR tools use ground-truth bug location information.
For QuixBugs, it correctly fixes 79 out of 80 real-world bugs, including 10 bugs that have not been fixed before. FixAgent fixes 24 more bugs than the best-performing APR baseline (AlphaRepair).
Plus, FixAgent patches 586 defects than the best LLM competitor (GPT4) on Codeflaws.
We also conduct extensive ablation studies on Codeflaws and a recently collected dataset, ConDefects (Python and Java), to mitigate the threat of data leakage in LLM training.
FixAgent can fix 368 bugs out of 600 sampled bugs in ConDefects, with 375 plausibly patched.
Results show that FixAgent performs well using various LLMs, not limited to its original setting (GPT4), and makes remarkable improvements compared to its base model.
The studies further demonstrate that each design contributes to FixAgent positively.

     is a pioneering work that aims to better combine FL and APR.
It leverages repair information to improve FL, believing that if a patch passes originally failing cases, its patch locations
should be highly correlated with the groundtruth bug locations.
Unified debugging highlights the important connection between APR and FL, thereby applying to our work.
Differently, we aim to provide fixed programs using an end-to-end solution, where the FL and APR have an interactive but not determinative relationship.
Such an architecture allows patching code elements beyond those localized by FL, and the FL results can also be adjusted based on repairs.

     Imperfect FL results include wrong and missing locations.
Such imperfection can considerably affect the downstream repair.=
Firstly, FL tools can incorrectly identify non-buggy code as the source of the error, making the repair approach generate patches that are not only unnecessary but could also introduce new errors.
As reported in
     <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">
      [
      <a class="ltx_ref" href="#bib.bib19" title="">
       19
      </a>
      ]
     </cite>
     , even state-of-the-art FL approaches suffer from low accuracy.
Prior techniques can only achieve less than 22.3%, and 46.3% real faulty statements are ranked as the top-1 and top-5 suspicious ones, respectively, on the real-world dataset Defects4J V1.2.0
     <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">
      [
      <a class="ltx_ref" href="#bib.bib43" title="">
       43
      </a>
      ]
     </cite>
     .
The result is far from satisfactory, and the patch space established based on such FL results can be problematic.
The overwhelming majority of APR tools are confined to replacing the identified statements with those produced by APR, potentially assuming perfect localization is easily available. Such an assumption is unrealistic and affects the debugging performance.
    </p>
   </div>
   <div class="ltx_para" id="S3.SS1.p2">
    <p class="ltx_p" id="S3.SS1.p2.1">
     Moreover, FL tools may miss faulty statements.
First, most FL and APR tools assume that each program only contains one bug existing in an existing code statement
     <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">
      [
      <a class="ltx_ref" href="#bib.bib44" title="">
       44
      </a>
      ]
     </cite>
     .
This is because 1) identifying multi-line bugs and making edits at multiple and non-contiguous locations is especially challenging
     <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">
      [
      <a class="ltx_ref" href="#bib.bib45" title="">
       45
      </a>
      ]
     </cite>
     ; and 2) APR tools often rely on spectrum-based FL, which can only isolate single-line bugs
     <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">
      [
      <a class="ltx_ref" href="#bib.bib46" title="">
       46
      </a>
      ]
     </cite>
     .
Second, failing case-dependent FL cannot identify bugs caused by non-existing statements. Such methods count the execution times of a certain statement, so they have difficulties finding missing conditions.
However, real-world bugs are complex and diverse, which may be multi-line or missing-line, calling for more sophisticated debugging to mitigate the threat of localization imperfection.

     The emergence of LLMs shed light on a potential solution to debugging.
A single LLM can already complete debugging. It simply regards debugging as producing tokens of a repair by calculating the probabilities from left to right, conditioned on the buggy program.
A recent study comprehensively evaluates the debugging capability of LLMs
     <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">

     .
It prompts LLMs to fix a buggy program without any other prior knowledge. Results show that the most advanced model, GPT4, can achieve comparable performance with humans on LeetCode, an online programming platform, submissions.
However, LLMs still face huge difficulties in fixing logic errors, and even runtime information of failing cases is unhelpful for such errors.

     displays a complex program with a logic bug and the wrong repair of GPT4. The wrong repair can pass most test cases but fail to calculate the number of tank-tap pairs given three houses and only one pipe, a corner case.
The key to this problem is to construct a directional chain using nodes and edges to represent the water-related objects, a thought of abstracting complex real-world systems into code.
Such insight requirement goes beyond language understanding and is challenging to LLMs. Thus, simply applying LLMs cannot meet the growing demand for complex software debugging, motivating us to create designs that better unleash their capability.

This case highlights the importance of program contexts.
Programming is a problem-solving task, so we should conduct context-aware program debugging for real-world software.

Localizer identifies faulty code statements. It can even point out missing statements and label them in the buggy program like “

      &lt;INFILL&gt; // missing this line causes a bug
     </span>
     ”.
Repairer aims to generate an executable and correct patch.
Revisitor analyzes why the original code was buggy and the rationale behind the patch.
The agents work sequentially. Each agent passes its response to the downstream agent, and responses from these agents make up the final response.

First, each agent is promoted with a clear role profile for task-oriented role-playing.
LLMs can act like an expected agent if given detailed role descriptions

      e.g.
     </span>
     , “You are an expert in identifying specific faulty code elements.”
The agent description introduces the specific task objective,

     , “Your task is to fix buggy code snippets.”
The role profile is followed by program specifications, including the buggy program, failing test case information, program contexts, and the response from the previous agent(s), if applicable. For example, we prompt the revisitor with identified bug locations generated by the localizer and a repair produced by the repairer.
Afterward, we underline the task objective and provide detailed step-by-step instructions.
For example, the repairer has the objective of returning the patch with an explanation in the desired format. It should carry out a series of steps: context comprehending, program analysis (including variable tracking introduced in

     The downstream agent relies on upstream results while influencing them in turn.
If the repairer generates a plausible patch that changes code statements different from the identified ones, the localizer also adjusts its results based on such changes, though it can also present the original responses upon user demand. Similarly, the analyzer may contain a better patch to boost the repairer or wiser localization, enabling answer adjusting for the localizer.
Besides, our pipeline enables FixAgent to handle multiple programs in parallel, like an assembly line.
The final answer returned to the user comes from their synergy, consisting of the identified buggy statements, the patch, and the post-error analysis.

     We prompt each agent to track critical intermediate variable values against failed test cases and compare them to expected outcomes.

     mentioned in the previous section.
Each agent is requested to explicitly present such tracking in its response, accompanied by a comprehensive explanation of how it facilitates the derivation of its answer.
This design is inspired by the rubber ducking, using explanations to enhance programming.
Compared with requiring line-by-line explanations as the original rubber ducking does, our design prioritizes information with significant impact on the program’s behavior, such as the core logic executions and states, helping LLM to concentrate on the parts that are most likely to influence the outcome, making it easier to identify and solve errors.
It also corresponds to chain-of-thought (CoT)
     <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">
      [
      <a class="ltx_ref" href="#bib.bib32" title="">

      </a>
      ]
     </cite>
     , whose idea is that decomposing a complex question into pieces can improve the reasoning capability of LLMs, and even simply adding “think it step by step” can lead to significant improvement.
Our tracking design allows LLMs to decompose a complex program with multiple logic modules into several intermediate states and conduct extra calculations during debugging.

   </div>
   <div class="ltx_para" id="S4.SS2.p2">
    <p class="ltx_p" id="S4.SS2.p2.1">
     Moreover, this design enhances the transparency of LLM decision-making.
We can see how an agent reaches its answer, enabling potential human interactions. For example, in a dynamic programming problem, developers can ask the model to focus on the state transfer equation and edge conditions.
Even if the agent cannot eventually generate a correct repair, the thinking path will still provide insights to developers.
Such interpretation also helps win the trust of developers.

     , requirements and dependencies.
First, for programs with detailed documentation, we adopt descriptions of the program functionality, input/output format, precision requirement, and other related information to clarify the expected behavior of the program.
If the program implements a well-known algorithm without documentation, we request a general LLM (may not be the base model of FixAgent) to introduce the algorithm given its name (usually the function name in the program). The introduction serves as a requirement description.
Second, we parse the dependencies of the buggy program and extract the code of these dependent files.
The extracted code is put on to the top of the program.
This operation, though simple, can work well by ensuring LLMs handles the dependent code first and then the buggy program, as most LLMs deal with tokens from left to right and are trained on file-level code.
These two strategies can construct an informative context for the program.

In the specification, the plausible repair replaces the buggy program.
Plus, it contains some given test cases to let crafter work in a few-shot manner because studies have shown that LLMs can perform new tasks well from a few examples

      .
In the instruction, crafter is asked to divergently think of diverse test cases that differ from given cases, aiming to reveal semantic flaws and boundary condition issues, especially prioritizing boundary values (maximum/minimum), repetitive inputs, and edge cases.
crafter also explains the rationale behind test cases to a rubber duck.
This guides crafter to mine diversified unusual inputs and encourages long test inputs.
Specifically, LLMs have a maximum token limit for a query and response, but we desire to generate extremely long inputs to uncover potential issues.
This can be achieved from the explanations.
For example, an input “

Instead, we only input one repair and its feedback for one sampling, avoiding the possibility of extending the token window of an LLM.
Lastly, the best repair with bug-fix analysis will be returned to the user. Users can also request the specific response of any agent, including the corresponding answer and explanation.

      Previous APR usually generates hundreds to thousands of patches per bug, whereas we only sample at most three times per bug for LLM baselines due to the high cost of token generation.
Comparing thousands of samples (APR studies) with only three samples (LLM baselines) seems unfair. Nevertheless, we follow the tradition of sampling only several times in code generation evaluation on LLMs

      , and the performance of LLMs is already incredible.
For evaluation purposes, we manually check the plausible patches. A patch is
      <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S5.SS1.SSS3.p2.1.1">
       correct
      </span>
      only when semantically equivalent to its corresponding reference patch or official answer in the programming contest platform.
We carefully check the correctness of each plausible patch of QuixBugs and 100 sampled plausible patches of Codeflaws in RQ1.
We do not check all patches of Codeflaws because 1) LLMs and FixAgent generate too many (thousands of) plausible patches, so it is extremely time-consuming to check them one by one; and 2) without ground-truth fault locations, these LLMs rewrite programs and change code statements, for example, replacing multiple “if else” by “switch case”, making it very different to manually check the correctness.
Thus, we follow

     This section presents the overall comparison between FixAgent and baselines on Codeflaws and QuixBugs among C, Java, and Python.
Since different APR approaches adopted different FL tools, we separate them according to the FL types adopted by their original papers, where standard FL refers to a traditional spectrum-based FL.
Perfect FL assumes a APR tool knows the ground-truth bug locations, though it is unrealistic.
Our work aims at an end-to-end solution without knowing the bug locations, so we do not provide FL results to our method and the base LLM baselines (

Overall, FixAgent plausibly patches 2780 out of 3982 bugs on Codeflaws and QuixBugs, performing the best compared to all baselines.
In particular, on the Codeflaws dataset, FixAgent significantly outperforms existing APR methods and LLMs. It produces 1.9X plausible patches as the best APR method, GenProg. Moreover, it improves the correctness rate by 57.42% compared to that of CoCoNuT, which correctly fixes the most bugs among APR methods.
We can also roughly estimate that FixAgent correctly fixes about 2512 bugs based on the correctness rate.
Moreover, FixAgent outperforms all compared approaches on QuixBugs. It correctly fixes 39 bugs in QuixBugs-Java, 7 of which have never been fixed before.
FixAgent correctly fixes all bugs in QuixBugs-Python, showing superiority over all baselines.

     displays an example bug of QuixBugs that is uniquely fixed by FixAgent. The bug wrongly returns an empty array, but it is desired as a nested empty array. It is difficult to fix by traditional and learning-based APR because it requires adding multi-line edits, which simple modifications cannot achieve, and goes beyond typical bug-fix templates.
Since QuixBugs only contains very brief descriptions of the programs, the debugging method must abstract the desired returning format from other returning statements in the program or the failing information (if any), requiring a comprehensive overview and deep analysis of the program. In fact, even FixAgent generates the correct patch upon the original failing test that triggers returning an empty set nested with an array.
Note that FixAgent fixes four extra bugs in QuixBugs compared with its base model GPT4. We will discuss the reasons in RQ2 (

     Furthermore, we find that LLMs achieve much better performance than traditional and NMT-based APR tools, with respect to both plausible patch generation and correctness rate, similar to previous findings

     .
LLMs achieve such results even without knowing fault locations, while APR baselines assume perfect FL or use a FL tool to facilitate repair generation.
Even the worst-performing LLM baseline, Gemini, achieves comparable results to the best traditional tool, GenProg.
We attribute this to the capabilities of LLMs in understanding the semantics and contexts of code.
LLMs can leverage the knowledge learned from previous source code to understand the program semantics and requirements deeply, enabling them to fix not only syntactic errors but also semantic errors that previous approaches might miss, especially when the bug does not correspond to predefined rules or templates that most APR baselines rely on.
Besides, LLMs more fully embody superiority on Codeflaws.
This is because Codeflaws challenges require a deeper understanding of real-world contexts and conditions under which programs are written, demanding more context understanding.
Every program in Codeflaws is written to solve a certain question described in natural languages connected with the real world, while QuixBugs consists of classic algorithms with one-line bugs that are more easily repaired by systematic modifications.

     FixAgent performs the best among LLM-based methods.
We attribute this to our designs.
LLM competitors conduct the whole debugging (or patch generation of AlphaRepair) in one turn, while FixAgent divides this complex task into several steps and requires explicit explanations focusing on crucial information.
We instantiate agents to conduct different stages of debugging separately.
Each agent can focus on its own and produce better results, so their synergy delivers better debugging performance.
In addition, we prompt the agents to pay attention to key variables.
Intuitively, if the program’s output does not conform to the expected, the bug usually appears before its final printing statement (though there are printing bugs, they are easy to fix), manifested by the intermediate values of variables, especially those in key logic expressions. Our prompt forces the agents to conduct reasoning along the program’s logic execution path, making bugs easily revealed.

     Note that the debugging results on QuixBugs among LLMs are very close, so we omit it in the following RQs. This is because 1) QuixBugs programs implement classic algorithms with single-line bugs that are relatively easy to fix, and 2) LLMs may have been trained on these algorithm implementations, so they deliver remarkable results due to data leakage.

     bugs.
FixAgent can correctly fix 115–205 bugs and plausibly patch 124–207 bugs out of the sampled 300 Java bugs using different LLMs.
It can also fix 89–163 and patch 99–168 Python bugs.
The results indicate that FixAgent can work effectively with various base LLMs, though influenced by their capabilities.
FixAgent with a larger model should perform better in experience, but FixAgent-DeepSeek-Coder outperforms FixAgent-ChatGPT and FixAgent-Gemini, while Gemini and ChatGPT have much larger model sizes.
We attribute this to the specialized training data and objective of DeepSeek-Coder. DeepSeek-Coder is a code LLM trained on a real-world code corpus, making it proficient at coding-related tasks, including debugging.
Though DeepSeek-Coder and CodeLlama are code LLM with similar model sizes, FixAgent-DeepSeek-Coder outperforms FixAgent-CodeLlama considerably. Their inherent coding ability gap can explain this.
As reported in
     <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">
      [
      <a class="ltx_ref" href="#bib.bib41" title="">
       41
      </a>
      ]
     </cite>
     , DeepSeek-Coder performs much better than CodeLlama on solving programming contests.
The debugging performance of LLM is strongly related to its coding ability, considering that debugging can be regarded as generating a correct program prompted by a buggy one.

     , where we sample 300 bugs in this evaluation for efficiency.
Compared to its base models, FixAgent plausibly patches 17–35 more bugs and correctly fixes 12–33 more bugs.
Among all compared pairs, FixAgent improves the most on GPT4, increasing correctly and plausibly patched bugs by 33 and 35, respectively.
Overall, applying FixAgent can make a 20% improvement on the original LLM, on average.
This enhancement highlights the effectiveness of our designs that significantly improve the debugging abilities of LLMs in a non-invasive manner without any re-training or fine-tuning, demonstrating our insight that LLMs can benefit from software principles, such as rubber ducking.

     The second important design is variable tracking. FixAgent generates 37 and 38 fewer plausible and correct patches, respectively, without tracking.
The foundation of this advancement is the enhancement of error diagnosis and reduction of reasoning overload in LLMs.
By verbally articulating the role and expected behavior of each variable, LLMs are more likely to pinpoint discrepancies between expected and actual outcomes, facilitating a targeted approach to repair, mirroring the effective rubber ducking strategy.
Furthermore, the structured explanation reduces the model’s reasoning overload.
Traditional CoT prompting, while effective in encouraging step-by-step reasoning, does not inherently prioritize information in a way that minimizes reasoning strain.
Instead, our strategy streamlines the process of LLMs in analyzing the program logic.
Using one agent to replace multi-agent synergy has a similar negative effect, which reduces 28 plausible and correct fixes.
The division of labor mirrors a well-established principle in software: specialization, which forces each agent to focus on its own task and reduces cognitive load.

     The least useful design is feedback-supported re-sampling. Though the added feedback provides more information, it expands the dialogue window, and the model must allocate its finite attention span to this new information, potentially at the expense of other critical details.
This trade-off may explain why the additional feedback does not significantly enhance the debugging capability of LLMs compared to independent sampling, as our results show.

      Though FixAgent significantly improves the debugging performance of multiple LLMs, its effectiveness is intrinsically tied to the foundational capabilities of the base model.
Indeed, our method can not fundamentally alter the intrinsic capabilities of LLMs; instead, it optimizes their existing skills within a proportional range.
For example, FixAgent improves Gemini by plausibly and correctly fixing 26 and 17 more bugs on Codeflaws, but its performance is still poorer than the simple application of GPT4.
Thus, models with inherently limited debugging abilities will not experience a significant leap in performance using FixAgent despite improvements. The ceiling enhancement is ultimately bounded by the capabilities of the LLM itself.
Hence, we adopt GPT4 as the default base model due to its advanced performance in a broad range of cognitive tasks

      We introduce an extra agent for test input generation to mitigate the overfitting problem, but it cannot directly calculate the corresponding expected outputs or test oracles, where a test oracle is a set of assertions that should pass when the program behaves as expected.
This is primarily due to the intrinsic probabilistic mechanisms of LLMs, making it challenging to accurately deliver precise answers to computational questions.
Addressing such problems akin to mathematical reasoning represents one of the significant challenges faced by LLMs.
Our approach cannot overcome their inherent limitations; therefore, additional information, such as correct code or manually computed answers, must be introduced to obtain the outputs for generated inputs and form complete test cases.

     First, we share the same major internal threat to validity with previous LLMs-based coding-related techniques where the training data of closed-sourced LLMs may overlap with our evaluation datasets.
Since we do not have access to the training data, we mitigate this threat from three steps.
1) We choose a recently collected dataset (ConDefects) for evaluation proposed to mitigate the data leakage problem of LLMs as its collection is posterior to the model release.
2) The other two datasets we use are believed to be not part of the training data as discussed in

     because 1) they have a low number of stars on GitHub, and 2) they focus on classic algorithms (QuixBugs) and programming assignments (Codeflaws) that do not belong to larger real-world projects.
3) RQ2

     demonstrates that our framework significantly improves the debugging effectiveness compared with its base LLM, where the improvement is orthogonal to the data leakage issue.
Second, we cannot directly determine the correct patches and rely on manual validation of plausible patches.
For Codeflaws and ConDefects, we have to check a sampled subset of the patches because of their huge size.
To mitigate this threat, we carefully validate the randomly sampled patches and all the patches for QuixBugs. Also, we generate more inputs using the crafter agent to test the plausible patches.

      External Threat
     </span>
     The main external threat lies in the evaluation dataset, where the superiority of FixAgent may not generalize to other datasets, especially for those less widely used programming languages that have less open-source code data for LLM training.
To mitigate this, we compare our method against advanced baselines, including both general LLMs and APR approaches on five benchmarks in three datasets, covering three programming languages.
Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of FixAgent among all these benchmarks.
We will also evaluate our approach to more datasets across more diverse programming languages in the future.

     has shown that FL can benefit from 16 different APR systems. However, existing studies only consider the contribution to FL made by APR.
We are the first to propose a unified framework enabling end-to-end debugging, where stages of the debugging have an interactional rather than determined relationship.

     Our method, FixAgent, provides an end-to-end solution for automated debugging with high effectiveness.
It performs a universal prompt design inspired by rubber ducking, which can significantly improve the debugging ability of LLMs in a non-intrusive style without any retraining/fine-tuning or historical bug-fix information.
FixAgent shows that LLMs can benefit from general software engineering principles recognized by developers, potentially besides rubber ducking.

    We propose FixAgent, the first unified debugging framework via LLM agent synergy.
It conducts fault localization, patch generation, and post-error analysis in an end-to-end manner.
Our insight is that LLMs can benefit from software engineering principles recognized by developers.
Thus, we follow the principle of rubber duck debugging-explaining the code in detail to create novel designs that unleash the debugging capability of LLMs and mitigate previous challenges.
The evaluation of two widely used datasets demonstrates the superiority of FixAgent over APR tools and LLM-based competitors, and extra experiments on recently collected data (avoiding data leakage) further show our generalization and effectiveness in debugging compared with base LLMs.
Our code and generated patches are publicly available for further research and reproduction.
