   Abstract
  </h6>
  <p class="ltx_p" id="id17.id1">
   Embodied AI is a crucial frontier in robotics, capable of planning and executing action sequences for robots to accomplish long-horizon tasks in physical environments.
In this work, we introduce EmbodiedGPT, an end-to-end multi-modal foundation model for embodied AI, empowering embodied agents with multi-modal understanding and execution capabilities.
To achieve this, we have made the following efforts:
(i) We craft a large-scale embodied planning dataset, termed EgoCOT. The dataset consists of carefully selected videos from the Ego4D dataset, along with corresponding high-quality language instructions. Specifically, we generate a sequence of sub-goals with the "Chain of Thoughts" mode for effective embodied planning.
(ii) We introduce an efficient training approach to EmbodiedGPT for high-quality plan generation, by adapting a 7B large language model (LLM) to the EgoCOT dataset via prefix tuning.
(iii) We introduce a paradigm for extracting task-related features from LLM-generated planning queries to form a closed loop between high-level planning and low-level control.
Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of EmbodiedGPT on embodied tasks, including embodied planning, embodied control, visual captioning, and visual question answering.
Notably, EmbodiedGPT significantly enhances the success rate of the embodied control task by extracting more effective features. It has achieved a remarkable 1.6 times increase in success rate on the Franka Kitchen benchmark and a 1.3 times increase on the Meta-World benchmark, compared to the BLIP-2 baseline fine-tuned with the Ego4D dataset.

    Embodied AI tasks, e.g., embodied planning, embodied VQA, and embodied control, aim to imbue robots with the ability to perceive, reason, and act within their environment, enabling them to perform long-horizon plans and execute actions autonomously based on real-time observations.
Recently, large language models (LLMs) such as GPT4

    , have shown promising language understanding, reasoning, and "chain-of-thought" capabilities.
Such advances may open new possibilities for developing robots capable of processing natural language instructions, performing multi-modal "chain-of-thought", and planning actions in physical environments.

    Large-scale datasets play important roles in training large language models.
For example, OpenCLIP trains its ViT-G/14 model on the LAION-2B dataset

    , which contains 2B image-language pairs.
Unlike general-purpose visual language tasks that can get a huge amount of weakly labeled image-caption pairs from the Internet, embodied AI tasks require egocentric data in robotics domains.
Also, structured language instructions are needed for precise planning, which usually requires huge manual efforts and costs.
This poses a challenging problem in collecting high-quality embodied multi-modal data.

However, several open questions still remain: how to apply LLMs to the field of robotics which may face large domain gaps; how to leverage the "chain-of-thought" capability for structured planning; and how to use the output language plan for downstream manipulation tasks in an end-to-end manner.

EmbodiedGPT comprises four integrated modules that work together, including i) a frozen vision model for encoding visual features of current observations, ii) a frozen language model used to execute natural language for question answering, captioning, and embodied planning tasks, iii) an embodied-former with a language mapping layer for aligning the visual and embodied instructions and extracting task-relevant instance-level features with the generated planning for low-level control, and iv) a policy network, which is responsible for producing low-level actions based on the task-relevant features, enabling the agent to effectively interact with the environment. To further enhance EmbodiedGPT ’s performance in generating reliable planning containing sub-goal sequences, we implement prefix tuning on the frozen language model to encourage the generation of more executable planning.

    Our method possesses the following core advantages: i) the generated planning exhibits strong executability and granularity at the object part level, such as the gripper of a robotic arm or the handle of a door, manifested in sub-goal sequences. ii) the proposed EgoCOT dataset is built based on an open-source large-scale dataset, which offers greater scalability compared to the PaLM-E

iii) EmbodiedGPT forms a closed-loop from high-level planning to low-level control, which enables seamless integration of high-level planning and low-level control, providing efficient task performance and adaptability to a wide range of tasks. To achieve this, we utilize the embodied-former to query task-relevant instance-level features through cross-attention between visual observations and generated embodied planning. This enables the policy network to complete low-level control tasks with fewer than 25 demonstrations.

(ii) We develop two datasets, EgoCOT and EgoVQA, consisting of 200M annotated videos from the Ego4D dataset with corresponding detailed planning instructions and VQA data. The datasets are first machine-generated, then semantics-based filtered, and finally human-verified for quality control.

     Vision-Language Pre-training focuses on strengthening the link between visual observation and natural language. The goal is to develop models that can better understand and process visual content, such as recognizing objects and actions, and generating descriptive text.
As models become larger, the computational expense for end-to-end pre-training rises, leading to the need for modular vision-language pre-training methods. These methods smartly use pre-trained models, keeping them ‘frozen’ during vision language pre-training to save on computational costs. For example, models like Uniter

Due to the lack of open-source data for multi-modal embodied planning, previous works struggled to perform detailed task decomposition and lacked the ability to generate precise and executable plans.
To tackle this issue, we create the EgoCOT dataset and develop an embodied chain-of-thought vision language pre-training framework to enhance the capacity of multi-modal models for embodied reasoning and planning.

    The goal of the embodied foundation model is to imitate human-like perception and interaction with the environment by accurately perceiving the environment, identifying relevant objects, analyzing their spatial relationships, and formulating a detailed task plan.

    , the embodied-former acts as a bridge between the visual and language domains, it first extracts compact visual features from the output of the vision model through attention-based interaction involving visual tokens, text queries, and learnable embodied queries and then maps it to the language modality through a language mapping layer.
These embeddings are sent to the frozen LLaMA

    language model for visual caption, visual QA, and embodied planning.
The generated planning is then used to query highly relevant features from the general visual tokens encoded by the visual model via the embodied-former. These features are utilized to generate low-level control commands for task execution through the downstream policy network. To enhance performance across a range of embodied tasks, we introduce a novel video-language pre-training paradigm that leverages a cognitive chain of thought to produce embodied planning from egocentric video inputs. We formulate this task as a standard VQA (Visual Question Answering) task, using "how to do the task that + original caption" as the question and embodied planning as the answer. This framework enriches the data of embodied planning and standard visual QA tasks, encouraging the embodied-former to capture task-specific features that are more suitable for embodied control tasks.

     untrimmed videos of various durations ranging from 5 seconds to 7 hours.
To prepare the data for our purposes, we conducted two stages of data cleaning to prepare our data. In the first stage, we filtered out videos with missing or very short narrations (which made up 7.4% and 0.9% of the text, respectively), as well as those with unsure tags (which accounted for 4.0% of the text). We also excluded videos without human-object interaction, such as watching TV or walking. After this stage, we were left with 2.9 thousand hours of video, containing 3.85 million narrations, from 129 different scenarios covering 2927 hours of video.

For each video segment, we provide prompts and corresponding captions for ChatGPT
     <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">
      [
      <a class="ltx_ref" href="#bib.bib55" title="">
       55
      </a>
      ]
     </cite>
     to generate a reasonable and detailed embodied planning. The caption is typically a brief introduction such as "C opens a drawer."
We use the ChatGPT to generate a chain of thought according to the caption and organize it into a list of verb-noun pairs, such as
     <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold ltx_font_italic" id="S3.SS4.p2.9.1" style="color:#666666;">
      "plans: grasp the handle with the gripper and pull the handle; actions: 1. grasp(handle, gripper) 2. pull(handle)."
     </span>
     The prompt we used to generate EgoCOT dataset is shown in Listing
     <a class="ltx_ref" href="#LST2" title="Listing 2 ‣ 3.4 Creating EgoCOT and EgoVQA Dataset ‣ 3 Method ‣ EmbodiedGPT: Vision-Language Pre-Training via Embodied Chain of Thought">
      <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">
       2
      </span>
     </a>
     . To enhance the diversity of generated chain of thoughts, we employ a temperature parameter of 0.9 and a top-p parameter of 0.95. For each prompt, we perform five sampling iterations.

     to assess the similarities between the video and text pairs. For each video, we compared it against five potential embodied plans and selected the one with the highest similarity as the corresponding label for the embodied plan.
We then took our data-cleaning process a step further by filtering out any video-caption-planning pairs with similarities lower than the threshold. We eliminated both data with the low similarity between the video and caption and between the video and planning to ensure the highest quality data for our EgoCOT dataset. For each keyframe of the video segment, we use the CLIP model to encode both the text data

We also created the EgoVQA dataset specifically for egocentric human-object interaction video question-answering tasks to enrich the training data. For each caption in the Ego4D dataset, we used ChatGPT to generate five QA pairs. To ensure relevance, we guided ChatGPT to focus on core key verbs and nouns by designing prompts as shown in Listing

    In order to evaluate the quality of generated captions and planning with the given image, we conducted a user study with 30 participants. The study included 10 cases of image caption tasks from MS-COCO dataset

    , 5 embodied planning scenarios in different embodied AI simulators, and 5 real-world scenes with accompanying embodied planning tasks. Participants were asked to rate the generated captions from different end-to-end models on five dimensions using a scoring system ranging from 1 to 10: object recognition accuracy, spatial relationship understanding, level of redundancy in the answer, and reasonability of the planning and the executability of the planning. The average scores among all the participants for different models are shown in Table

    .
The results demonstrate that EmbodiedGPT achieves a comparable level of object recognition and spatial relationship understanding as the LLaVA-13B model, despite having only 7B parameters in the language model. Furthermore, EmbodiedGPT generates less redundant content in relation to the given embodied AI task, and produces the most reasonable and executable planning outputs.
We also compared the performance of EmbodiedGPT with Visual ChatGPT

    , Visual ChatGPT failed to find a coat hanger due to its limitations of relying solely on the caption model for extracting visual information, resulting in poor performance when compared to the end-to-end model like EmbodiedGPT. These findings highlight the advantages of adopting a unified, end-to-end model over hierarchical approaches that rely on multiple stages.

given a demonstration video, EmbodiedGPT can accurately interpret the embodied control task and provide step-by-step planning. The output planning is fed into the Embodied-former module of EmbodiedGPT to query highly relevant features for use as inputs in the policy network and the low-level actions are generated by the policy network to interact with the environment (see more visualizations in Appendix B).

In all experiments, the policy network is learned using few-shot learning on a small amount of demonstration data. There are two settings, one of which utilizes 10 demonstrations, and the other utilizes 25 demonstrations.

    In summary, EmbodiedGPT exhibits a strong ability to generate reasonable planning, accurately extract task-relevant features from visual inputs, as well as execute low-level actions to interact with the environment. The ablation experiments demonstrate that both the training paradigm based on EgoCOT and the closed-loop design from embodied planning to low-level control significantly contribute to the performance improvement of EmbodiedGPT.

   Conclusion

   <p class="ltx_p" id="S5.p1.1">
    In this paper, we present EmbodiedGPT, an end-to-end multi-modal foundational model for embodied AI that enables agents to perform step-by-step planning and execute low-level commands. To achieve this, we create a large-scale embodied planning dataset called EgoCOT and develop an efficient training approach that utilizes prefix tuning to generate high-quality plans with a "chain-of-thought". Furthermore, our embodied control paradigm seamlessly coordinates high-level planning and low-level control. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of EmbodiedGPT on various embodied tasks, achieving state-of-the-art or comparable performance. We believe that EmbodiedGPT represents a significant step towards developing more intelligent embodied AI agents.

     Future works and limitations:
    </span>
    EmbodiedGPT freezes the parameters of the vision and language model due to limited computational resources. Joint training with all modules and exploring other modalities, such as speech, could be future works. We do not foresee obvious undesirable ethical or social impacts at this moment.

     We adopt imitation learning as the method of policy learning in low level control tasks, which leverages demonstration data provided by an expert to learn the desired behavior. This technique has found applications in various domains, such as robotics, autonomous driving, and game playing. We provide each task 25 demonstrations, which are trajectories of observations and actions performed by an expert in the given task, and test the performance with 25 demonstrations and only 10 demonstrations respectively. The goal of imitation learning is to learn a policy, denoted as

Speciffically, we use behavioral cloning to learn the downstream policy, which trains a supervised learning model to predict actions given states based on the expert demonstrations, and the loss function is shown as Equation

For abstract task scenarios, EmbodiedGPT adeptly combined visual observations with abstract concepts to generate concrete sub-task descriptions. For instance, when given the abstract prompt of feeling hot, the model identified pertinent objects in the environment (e.g., a fan) and suggested a practical solution (e.g., turning on the fan). Subsequently, the model generated a detailed plan to accomplish the identified sub-tasks, highlighting its adaptability across diverse problem-solving contexts.

   Insight about the prompt designing for multi-modal large model
  </h2>
  <div class="ltx_para" id="A4.p1">
   <p class="ltx_p" id="A4.p1.1">
    Through extensive experiments evaluating multi-modal large models in question answering tasks, we have identified a limitation in their ability to effectively utilize visual information. These models tend to rely heavily on textual inputs and may not fully exploit the visual cues present in the question-answering process. In order to address this limitation and enhance their performance, we aimed to investigate the impact of incorporating additional prompts that guide the model’s attention towards the visual content.
   </p>
  </div>
  <div class="ltx_para" id="A4.p2">
   <p class="ltx_p" id="A4.p2.1">
    To achieve this goal, we propose a straightforward yet highly effective approach: incorporating additional prompting into the model’s input. This involves introducing specific prompts such as "in the scene shown in this image/video" or allowing the model to describe the image/video as part of a multi-turn dialogue. By including these prompts, we aim to explicitly direct the model’s focus towards the visual information available and encourage it to utilize this information when generating answers.
Our experiments have yielded promising results. The introduction of additional prompts has significantly improved the model’s ability to leverage visual information and provide accurate answers based on the visual content. By explicitly referencing the scene depicted in the image or video, the model’s attention is directed towards the relevant visual features, leading to a more comprehensive integration of visual and textual information. Consequently, the model’s reasoning ability is enhanced, resulting in more precise and contextually grounded answers.
