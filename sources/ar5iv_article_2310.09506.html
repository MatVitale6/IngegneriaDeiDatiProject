   Abstract

  <p class="ltx_p" id="id1.id1">
   The forthcoming 6G systems are expected to address a wide range of non-stationary tasks. This poses challenges to traditional medium access control (MAC) protocols that are static and predefined. In response, data-driven MAC protocols have recently emerged, offering ability to tailor their signaling messages for specific tasks. This article presents a novel categorization of these data-driven MAC protocols into three levels: Level 1 MAC. task-oriented neural protocols constructed using multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL); Level 2 MAC. neural network-oriented symbolic protocols developed by converting Level 1 MAC outputs into explicit symbols; and Level 3 MAC. language-oriented semantic protocols harnessing large language models (LLMs) and generative models. With this categorization, we aim to explore the opportunities and challenges of each level by delving into their foundational techniques. Drawing from information theory and associated principles as well as selected case studies, this study provides insights into the trajectory of data-driven MAC protocols and sheds light on future research directions.

    Akin to language, a communication protocol in the medium access control (MAC) layer is a set of grammar and rules that govern the composition and exchange of signaling messages among network nodes to carry out communication control actions. This parallel to human language is not accidental – just as a language enables humans to communicate and understand one another, a MAC protocol enables devices to communicate and coordinate with each other. However, while human language naturally evolves and adapts over time to changing needs and contexts, traditional MAC protocols are human-crafted via standardization, with predefined rules and signaling messages. This approach has been successful in the past, but is being seriously challenged with the looming advent of new, diverse service verticals in 6G

    Compared to previous generations, 5G considers three distinct service types, i.e., enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), massive machine-type communication (mMTC), and ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC). To accommodate these service types, significant effort has been exerted to tailor MAC protocols to satisfy the key performance indicators (KPIs) of each service

Looking ahead, 6G is anticipated to encompass an even broader range of verticals, each with their task-sensitive requirements such as autonomous cars in vehicle-to-everything (V2X) networks and visuo-haptic immersive applications in the metaverse. Furthermore, 6G services are expected to address non-stationary environments, such as satellites in non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) as well as control-communication co-designed communication (CoCoCo) for remote-controlled drones, cars, and mobile robots

    where agents structured as neural networks (NNs) exchange their hidden-layer outputs as signaling messages during action executions within the MADRL framework. Though these message may initially appear arbitrary, they progressively acquire significance for inter-agent coordination as agents learn to refine actions and improve task efficiency. Consequently, bypassing expensive standardization processes, the emergent mappings from signaling messages to agents’ states and control actions are innately suited for the task at hand.

    , advancements in Level 1 MAC can directly lead to improvements in Level 2 MAC, emphasizing the importance of optimizing Level 1 MAC design. However, feasible manipulations in Level 2 MAC are limited by the original task knowledge stored in the NN of Level 1 MAC. For adapting to non-stationary task environments, both Level 1 and Level 2 MAC protocols necessitate NN re-training.

     . Emerging 6G applications are expected to have stringent latency and energy requirements, particularly in non-stationary and mission-critical environments. To address these demands, departing from the prevailing transmitter-centered and task-agnostic communication systems, there is a growing emphasis on receiver-centered and task-oriented communication frameworks. One notable example is pull-based communication, where transmissions are initiated solely based on receivers’ requests
     <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">

       14

     </cite>
     . The timing for these transmission opportunities can be determined by the age of outdated receiver information, also known as the age-of-incorrect information (AoII)

     On the other hand, to cater to the challenges of unknown source data and channel distributions, AI-native communication frameworks are gaining traction. Within these frameworks, transceivers’s end-to-end functionality is realized through an NN that ideally acts as a universal function approximator. These neural transceivers are trained directly with actual source and channel data while executing specific tasks, which aligns seamlessly with the task-oriented design paradigm. Recent AI-native communication frameworks have demonstrated their effectiveness in various tasks ranging from image and video reconstruction to recommendation and control, achieved by jointly optimizing source-channel coding, analog-digital modulation, and other pre/post-processing functionalities

     However, much of the current research primarily concentrates on the physical layer (PHY) within a point-to-point setting. With slight modifications, the advantages and core principles of task-oriented and AI-naitve communication frameworks can be extended to higher layers, notably the MAC layers. Building on this perspective and viewing a MAC protocol as a language emerged from specific tasks, we will delve into task-oriented language emergence through MADRL as elaborated next.

     . Deep RL aims to achieve this goal by rewarding action decisions and learning policies using NNs. While standalone deep RL considers a single decision-maker, i.e. a single actor or a single agent, MADRL involves multiple agents in a shared environment. Therefore, it is instrumental in coordinating different agents for cooperative, competitive, or hybrid tasks. To coordinate agents, a prevailing method is rewarding by a centralized entity during training, i.e., a centralized critic, resulting in the centralized-training and decentralized execution (CTDE) framework.
While effective in simple environments, decentralized execution may not always be functional under complicated inter-agent interactions, such as interference and collision.
The MARL with communication frameworks

     It is however non-trivial to manually design such cheap-talk communication messages for MADRL. Alternatively, the MARL with communication framework is a prominent direction, wherein agents exchange their NN’s hidden-layer outputs across agents in both training and execution. These NN outputs are random values at the beginning, but they gradually become meaningful as the training progresses. After training completes, the NN outputs can be regarded as emergent neural messages for coordinating multiple agents.
The first of its kind is the differentiable inter-agent learning (DIAL) and reinforced inter-agent learning (RIAL) algorithms that consider continuous and discrete communication channels, respectively

     . Both RIAL and DIAL rely on sequential communication wherein each agent takes an action and sends a neural message to the next agent one by one. Extending this sequential operations to a parallel architecture, it is possible to exploit the same principle in protocol learning as we will explore in the next section.

     The operations of a neural protocol includes several causal relations which are implicitly facilitated during its training. Identifying key causation and boosting it can improve not only the effectiveness of the neural protocol in Level 2 MAC, but also the compactness of the neuro-symbolic semantic protocol in Level 3 MAC. To illustrate this, we revisit the single-cell MAC protocol learning scenario in Sec.

These state, uplink message, downlink message, and action correspond to an actor NN’s input, a lower hidden layer’s output, an upper hidden layer’s output, and the final layer’s output, respectively. Given these two actor NNs, during training, a shared critic NN gives a reward

      Limitation of Level 1 MAC
     </span>
     . While effective in achieving high performance, Level 1 MAC inherits the fundamental limitations of NNs, in terms of computing efficiency, management flexibility, and generalization. In essence, task-oriented neural protocols rely on NN architectures that are over-parameterized for ease of training

     , incurring high computation, communication, and memory costs at execution.
The NN is also a black-box function, making the protocol operations uninterpretable. Furthermore, it requires re-training in dynamic environments, such as the number of users, channel statistics, and tasks, thus hindering immediate reconfiguration and reducing the flexibility in protocol operations. Lastly, even under the same environment, gradient-based training does not guarantee obtaining the NN with the same model parameters
, leading to protocol fragmentation.

These methods first build the structure of invariant concepts and their relations as a knowledge base, and then feed actual data into the knowledge base to generate communication messages. Similarly, the current generation of the Web, i.e., Web 3.0 also known as the semantic web, employs the same idea to make Internet data machine-readable. It first creates an ontology graph, and feeds actual data into the ontology graph to produce a knowledge graph (KG) representing semantic relations in Web documents. For instance, consider an ontology graph {

     To overcome the fundamental limitations of neural protocols in Level 1 MAC, Level 2 MAC aims to reveal protocol operations explicitly. In fact, the NN architecture of neural protocols is not always mandatory at execution after training. Instead, treating a trained NN as a simulator, it is possible to extract symbolic protocol operations (i.e., NN outputs) by feeding agents’ possible states (i.e., NN inputs). In this neural-to-symbolic transformation, the NN’s data feed-forwarding architectural order determines the causality in protocol operations, e.g., {

After finalizing this neural-to-symbolic transformation, the resultant set of protocol rules yields a symbolic protocol that emulates the original neural protocol without running any NNs. This transformation enables to make protocol operations reconfigurable, compute-efficient, and comparable with other protocols as we shall elaborate in the following subsections.

      Limitation of Level 2 MAC
     </span>
     . Unlike Level 1 MAC protocols requiring re-training for any protocol adjustments, Level 2 MAC protocols permit direct manipulations. However, the scope of such adjustments should be confined within the protocol’s original task knowledge. Violating this knowledge interpolation requirement may compromise the effectiveness of protocol operations in given tasks. One potential workaround is to leverage the memory-efficiency of Level 2 MAC. In other words, one can pre-train multiple neural protocols across various tasks, and utilize a portfolio of their symbolic protocols storing large task knowledge as discussed in

     . As discussed above, merely enhancing task knowledge is not a sustainable strategy for coping with unseen task environments. Instead of taking this route, one can take the opposite direction by seeking general knowledge that can later be tailored to task-specific knowledge. The pursuit of this general knowledge has been a topic of debate in the past, but the rise of large language models (LLMs) has brought it to the forefront of recent research discussions. An LLM is a large NN trained on a vast corpus of human language data. For example, to capture general knowledge in form of human language, Llama 2 structured with

     Level 1 MAC and Level 2 MAC protocols only involve task-specific knowledge, and therefore lack the ability to extrapolate beyond their original task. To circumvent this limitation, Level 3 MAC employs human language as signaling messages, and seek to leverage the general knowledge embedded within LLMs. In this respect, Level 3 MAC is

     where signaling messages mirror the semantics of human language. Employing human language imbues semantic protocols with inherent interpretability, ensuring native interoperability among machine agents and even with human operators. In addition, harnessing LLM’s general knowledge offers flexibility in adjusting protocol operations, while enabling reasoning about it, making the underlying rationale of these adjustments transparent.

    <p class="ltx_p" id="S4.SS2.p2.1">
     However, the general knowledge stored in LLMs can be overly broad to address specific tasks. Indeed, human language contains numerous polysemous words (i.e., words having multiple semantics), which poses potential misinterpretations during protocol operations. This emphasizes the need to refine general knowledge into task-specific knowledge. While LLMs are NNs that can be fine-tuned by adjusting their model parameters, their extensive parameter count incurs excessive computing resources and additional data. In-context learning is a viable alternative, which adjusts the LLM’s outputs without altering its model parameters. While updating model parameters is about gaining more knowledge, in-context learning refines pre-trained LLM’s general knowledge by delimiting the scope of interest within the LLM’s general knowledge in a latent space. Drawing a parallel with humans who can discern intended semantics through additional examples and contexts, in-context learning demonstrates few task-related examples written in texts to the LLM, thereby deriving the LLM associated with task-conditional general knowledge that functions as task-specific knowledge.

     While LLMs are rooted in human language, their general knowledge is not limited to linguistic data. Actually, the training data of LLMs encompasses a substantial amount of non-linguistic information, including text captions associated with videos and programming codes. Moreover, LLMs can readily interpret non-linguistic data given the right mappings between linguistic and non-linguistic data. In this regard, cross-modal generative models are instrumental. For instance, BLIP is a pre-trained NN that retains cross-attention information between images and their corresponding text captions, which facilitates conversions from images to text tokens (i.e., image-to-text, I2T) and the reverse (i.e., text-to-image, T2I).

            should choose “east” as it brings them closer to the goal and has medium channel power.

    Conclusion and Future Directions

   <p class="ltx_p" id="S5.p1.1">
    In this article we have categorized data-driven MAC protocols into three levels: Level 1. task-oriented neural protocol, Level 2. NN-oriented symbolic protocol, and Level 3. language-oriented semantic protocol. To grasp the opportunities and challenges presented by these three-level protocols, we delved into their underlying key techniques and principles. Selected case studies showed that information-theoretic methods hold immense potential for enhancing both Level 1 and Level 2 MAC protocols, and they also provide tools for evaluating the structural and operational complexities of Level 2 MAC.
   </p>
  </div>
  <div class="ltx_para" id="S5.p2">
   <p class="ltx_p" id="S5.p2.1">
    To address severe task variability that cannot be addressed by the task-specific knowledge of Level 1 and Level 2 MAC, Level 3 MAC additionally utilizes generic knowledge embedded in LLMs. However, existing hardware and LLM architectures are not yet to achieve best efficiency, leading to considerable computation overhead and latency during execution. For instance, Llama incurs 13 GFLOPS of computation complexity and achieves 30 token (approx. 20 words) generation rate per second on consumer-grade GPUs. This contrasts sharply with the 8 FLOPS and 14K FLOPS observed in our simulations for Level 1 and Level 2 MAC, respectively. This discrepancy presents a trade-off between Level 2 and Level 3 MAC. Balancing this trade-off could be an interesting topic for future study. Furthermore, by extending the LLM latent space theory, it could be promising to develop novel information theoretic methods for optimizing Level 3 MAC. Lastly, considering that semantic communication has been extensively studied at the PHY layer, integrating semantic PHY and semantic MAC protocols would emerge as another intriguing topic for future exploration.
