  <p class="ltx_p" id="id7.id1">
   Semantic reasoning and dynamic planning capabilities are crucial for an autonomous agent to perform complex navigation tasks in unknown environments. It requires a large amount of common-sense knowledge, that humans possess, to succeed in these tasks. We present SayNav, a new approach that leverages human knowledge from Large Language Models (LLMs) for efficient generalization to complex navigation tasks in unknown large-scale environments. SayNav uses a novel grounding mechanism, that incrementally builds a 3D scene graph of the explored environment as inputs to LLMs, for generating feasible and contextually appropriate high-level plans for navigation. The LLM-generated plan is then executed by a pre-trained low-level planner, that treats each planned step as a short-distance point-goal navigation sub-task. SayNav dynamically generates step-by-step instructions during navigation and continuously refines future steps based on newly perceived information. We evaluate SayNav on a new multi-object navigation task, that requires the agent to utilize a massive amount of human knowledge to efficiently search multiple different objects in an unknown environment. SayNav outperforms an oracle based Point-nav baseline, achieving a success rate of 95.35% (vs 56.06% for the baseline), under the ideal settings on this task, highlighting its ability to generate dynamic plans for successfully locating objects in large-scale new environments. In addition, SayNav also enables efficient generalization of learning to navigate from simulation to real novel environments.

     Finding multiple target objects in a novel environment
    </span>
    is a relatively easy task for a human but a daunting task for an autonomous agent. Given such a task, humans are able to leverage common-sense priors like room layouts and plausible object placement to infer likely locations of objects. For example, there are higher chances of finding a pillow on the bed in the bedroom and a spoon on the dining table or in the kitchen. Humans are also capable of dynamically planning and adjusting their search strategies and actions based on new visual observations during exploration in a new environment. For example, a human would search for a spoon first instead of a pillow if entering a kitchen.

    . SayNav follows this trend of utilizing LLMs in developing generalist planning agents specifically for navigation tasks. To fully demonstrate and validate SayNav’s capabilities, we define a new navigation task, multi-object navigation. For this task, the agent needs to efficiently explore a new 3D environment to locate multiple different objects given the names of these objects. This task requires a large amount of prior knowledge and dynamic planning capabilities (similar to humans) for success.

    The key innovation of SayNav is to incrementally build and expand a 3D scene graph of the new environment using perceived information during exploration. It then grounds feasible and contextually appropriate knowledge from LLMs which is used by the agent for navigation. This new grounding mechanism ensures that LLMs adhere to the physical constraints in the new environment, including the spatial layouts and geometric relationships among perceived entities.

    have recently emerged as powerful high-level representations of 3D large-scale environments to support real-time decisions in robotics. A 3D scene graph is a layered graph which represents spatial concepts (nodes) at multiple levels of abstraction (such as objects, places, rooms, and buildings) with their relations (edges). We utilize this 3D scene graph representation to ground LLMs in the current environment, which is used to continuously build and refine the search plan for the agent during navigation.

   <p class="ltx_p" id="Sx1.p5.1">
    Specifically, SayNav utilizes LLMs to generate step-by-step instructions on the fly, for locating target objects during navigation. To ensure feasible and effective planning in a dynamic manner, SayNav continuously extracts and converts a subgraph (from the current 3D scene graph) into a textual prompt to be fed to the LLMs. This extracted subgraph includes spatial concepts in the local region centered around the current position of the agent. The LLM then plans next steps based on this subgraph, such as inferring likely locations for the target object and prioritizing them. This plan also includes conditional statements and fallback options when any of the steps is unable to achieve the goal. For example, if the agent is not able to find the laptop on the desk, it will go to a next likely location (bed) in a bedroom.

    SayNav also leverages LLMs to augment and refine the scene graph during navigation, such as annotating the room type based on current perceived objects. This improves the hierarchical organization of semantic information in the scene graph, that can support better memory and future planning using relevant information at suitable levels. In addition, SayNav also computes the feasibility of completing the current goal based on the room type. For example, it can skip the restroom when looking for a spoon, but can come back later if needed.

The LLM-generated plan is then executed by a pre-trained low-level planner that treats each planned step as a short-distance point-goal navigation sub-task (such as moving to perceived object A). This decomposition reduces the planning complexity of the navigation task, because the sub-tasks planned by LLMs are simple enough for low-level planners to execute successfully.

    illustrates an example of SayNav utilizing LLMs to efficiently explore a new environment and locate one (laptop) of the three target objects. The agent first looks around (i.e., observes to build the scene graph) and identifies what type of room it starts from. After checking potential locations of the target objects in the room, the agent does not find any target. Then it decides to go through the door to move to another room. The agent continuously expands the scene graph during exploration and realizes that the neighbor room is a living room. There, it finds one target on the table and continues searching for other two objects.

Here we define three different objects as the targets for each episode for experiments. We test SayNav on this dataset and compare its performance to a strong baseline method. Our results demonstrate that SayNav is capable of grounding LLMs to generate sound and successful plans in a dynamic manner for the complex multi-object navigation task.

    have focused on the AI-THOR based environment that consists of only a single room. Moreover, these methods only rely on detection of specific objects. They do not consider room layout and the topological arrangement of perceived entities inside the room, which are important to ground LLMs in the physical environment for visual navigation tasks. Therefore, knowledge extracted from LLMs using these methods might not be contextually appropriate to an agent for navigation in large-scale settings, such as multi-room houses.

    Second, these LLM-based planners typically generate a multi-step long-horizon plan in the beginning for the assigned task, which is not feasible for navigating in unknown environments. They also lack the capability to change the plan during task execution. In contrast, an effective search plan for navigation in new places is required to be incrementally generated and updated during exploration. Future actions are decided based on current perceived scenes with the memory of previously-visited regions.

    Our approach, SayNav, is designed to leverage LLMs specifically for visual navigation in unknown large-scale environments. We propose a new grounding mechanism that incrementally builds a 3D scene graph of the explored environment as inputs to LLMs, for generating the high-level plans. SayNav also dynamically generates step-by-step instructions during navigation. It continuously refines future steps based on newly perceived information via LLMs.

    . It uses LLMs to find the nearby semantic frontier based on detected objects, for expanding the exploration area to eventually find the target object. For example, moving to the (sofa, table) region which is more likely to have TV. In other words, it utilizes LLMs to hint to the next exploration direction. It does not use LLMs as a full high-level planner, that generates step-by-step instructions. In contrast, our SayNav uses the 3D scene graph to ground LLMs as a high-level planner. Our LLM-based planner generates the instructions in a dynamic manner, and considers its prior planned steps to generate better future plans.

     We define a new navigation task, multi-object navigation, to validate SayNav. The goal of this task is to navigate the agent in a large-scale unknown environment in order to find an instance for each of three predefined object categories (such as ”laptop”, ”tomato”, and ”bread”). The agent is initialized at a random location in the environment and receives the goal object categories (

     , the agent first realizes that it is in the bedroom and then decides to prioritize places (such as the table) to locate the laptop inside this room. On the other hand, if the agent moves to the kitchen, it will be more efficient to search for the fork and spoon first. Therefore, this new task requires extensive semantic reasoning and dynamic planning capabilities, as what humans possess, for an autonomous agent to explore in large-scale unknown environments.

     . The corresponding pseudo-code is in Algorithm 1. It includes three modules: (1) Incremental Scene Graph Generation, (2) High-Level LLM-based Dynamic Planner, and (3) Low-Level Planner. The Incremental Scene Graph Generation module accumulates observations received by the agent to build and expand a scene graph, which encodes semantic entities (such as objects and furniture) from the areas the agent has explored. The High-Level LLM-based Dynamic Planner continuously converts relevant information from the scene graph into text prompts to a pre-trained LLM, for dynamically generating short-term high-level plans. Each LLM-planned step is executed by the Low-Level Planner to generate a series of control commands for execution.

     This module continuously builds and expands a 3D scene graph of the environment being explored. A 3D scene graph is a layered graph which represents spatial concepts (nodes) at multiple levels of abstraction with their relations (edges). This representation has recently emerged as a powerful high-level abstraction for 3D large-scale environments in robotics. Here we define four levels in the 3D scene graph: small objects, large objects, rooms, and house. Each spatial concept is associated with its 3D coordinate. The edges reveal the topological relationships among semantic concepts across different levels. Figure

     The scene graph is built using environmental observations received by the agent during exploration. The depth of each segmented object can be obtained based on RGBD images and semantic segmentation images. The 3D coordinate of each perceived object can then be estimated by combining its depth information and the agent’s pose. Based on the 3D coordinates of perceived objects and their topological relationships, a scene graph can be constructed.

     We also utilize LLMs to augment and refine high-level abstractions of the scene graph. For example, we use LLMs to annotate and identify the spatial entity (room type) at the room level of the graph based on its connected objects at lower levels. For instance, a room is probably a bedroom if it includes a bed.

     Similar to previous works in LLM-based planning, SayNav utilizes a two-level planning architecture to reduce the learning complexity of the assigned task. However, instead of generating a complete high-level plan for the entire task in the beginning

     Our high-level LLM-based dynamic planner extracts a subgraph from the full 3D scene graph and converts it into text prompts, which are fed to an LLM. The extracted subgraph includes spatial concepts in the local region centered around the current position of the agent. We implemented the LLM prompts similar to

     , which constructs programming language prompts based on the text labels in the extracted subgraph. Once prompts are received, the LLM planner outputs short-term step-by-step instructions, as pseudo code. The generated plan provides an efficient search strategy within the current perceived area based on human knowledge, prioritizing locations to visit inside the room based on the likelihoods of target objects being discovered. For example, LLM may provide a plan to first check the desk and then the bed to find the laptop in the bedroom. Figure

     The LLM-based planner extends and updates the plan when the previous plan fails or the task goal (finding three objects) is not achieved after the previous short-term plan executes. SayNav also uses the 3D scene graph to support memory for future planning. For example, it automatically annotates the rooms that have been investigated. Therefore, it will not generate repeated plans when the agent revisits the same room during exploration.

In SayNav, however, the two-level planning architecture simplifies the job of the low-level planner. The low-level planner mostly outputs control commands for short-range movements. The LLM-based high-level planner is also robust to failures in the low-level planner, by making regular plan updates. In this way, the training load required on the low-level planner can be greatly reduced.

We opted for the recently introduced ProcTHOR framework, which is built on top of the AI2-THOR simulator, for our experiments

ProcTHOR is capable of procedurally generating full floor plans of a house given a room specification. For example, the house shown in Figure

     </a>
     consists of 5 rooms. It also populates each floorplan with 108 object types, with realistic, physically plausible, and natural placements. We can evaluate SayNav’s ability to navigate in large-scale unknown environments and find objects, by using the houses generated from this framework. We build a dataset of 132 houses and select three objects for each house to conduct new multi-object navigation task.

     . SR measures the percentage of cases where the agent is able to find all the three objects successfully, while SPL normalizes the success by ratio of the shortest path to actual path taken. We use the minimum of the shortest path from the starting point to permutations of all the target objects. In addition to these two metrics, we measure the similarity between the object ordering obtained by the agent and that by the ground-truth. The ground-truth object ordering gives an idea of how a perfect agent would have explored the space by first identifying objects that are highly probably in current room/scene-graph and then exploring other rooms. We use the Kendall distance metric

     Note that SayNav consists of three modules– incremental scene graph generator, LLM-based planner, and a low-level planner. The major goal for our evaluation is to fully validate and verify the LLM-based planning capabilities in SayNav to multi-object navigation. Therefore, we implemented two options for each of the other two modules for evaluation.

     . We found the drop in SR can be associated with various challenges encountered in any perception based algorithms. The inaccurate estimation of objects’ 3D positions due to partial observations can lead to failures in detecting targets and navigation. In addition, we remove objects less than 20 pixels on semantic segmentation observations for more practical behavior. Therefore, very small objects can also be missed-out while building the scene graph from visual observations. We also observed a specific challenge in
     <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="Sx4.SSx1.p2.2.5">
      VO
     </span>
     associated with estimating the location of glass doors. From the depth map, the depths of visible objects behind the glass door represent the depths of the actual physical door, which fails the estimation of the location of the door. A similar trend can be found from results with

We believe it is due to LLM-based dynamic planning capabilities, with the grounding mechanism based on incremental scene graph generation.

environment. It also refines or corrects the plan in case of any failure in a planned step.

     where the agent is asked to locate an alarm-clock, a laptop, and a cellphone in an unknown house. The agent happens to start in the kitchen (determined by LLM based on perceived objects). The planner reasons that it is unlikely to find either of the objects there, so it decides to go to another room through a door. Then, it comes to a living-room where it is able to locate the laptop and cellphone. The third object still remains unfound, so it again decides to go to another room via a door. Eventually, it locates the alarm-clock in the final room.

    We present SayNav, a new approach for efficient generalization to complex navigation tasks in unknown large-scale environments. SayNav incrementally builds and converts a 3D scene graph of the explored environment to LLMs, for generating dynamic and contextually appropriate high-level plans for navigation. We evaluate SayNav on a new multi-object navigation task, that requires the agent to efficiently search multiple different objects in an unknown environment. Our results demonstrate SayNav outperforms a strong oracle based Point-nav baseline (95.35% vs 56.06%) under the ideal settings, for successfully locating objects in large-scale new environments.

     This result shows that using a better LLM (gpt-4 in this case) enables an improvement in use of common-sense priors and is able to yield optimal ordering. The results also highlight that our prompts are not only simple but also general enough to work with multiple LLM models. We believe that using simpler prompts will allow easy transfer to other robotic tasks such as manipulation. We plan to evaluate our approach on more complex tasks in future work.

    Memory via LLM

   <div class="ltx_para" id="A3.SSx2.p1">
    <p class="ltx_p" id="A3.SSx2.p1.1">
     As mentioned in the primary manuscript, SayNav uses the 3D scene graph to support memory for future planning. For instance, it automatically annotates the room nodes that have already been investigated and won’t plan for the room if the agent happens to visit the same room again.
This type of implementation to support memory works perfectly for our chosen task. However, we also wanted to explore the possibility of making the LLM track its own plans. Hence, we also implemented SayNav’s memory via LLM by using Conversational Chains module of the LangChain framework

        https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/chains/how_to/memory
       </span>
      </span>
     </span>
     . Here we use two separate instances of identical LLM models, one to generate the high level plans and another to track the generated plans. The LLM tracking the generated plan, uses the
     <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="A3.SSx2.p1.1.1">
      Room Tracking Prompt

     in Figure

      </span>
     </a>
     and is also equipped with a conversational memory.
The LLM responsible for generating the plans receives detailed description of the surrounding environment while the other LLM instance only receives the minimal information necessary to do the tracking. A key advantage of this framework is that it avoids hitting the maximum token limit on the LLM by not relying on the entire conversational history (as is usually done). We believe that LLM-based tracking might be able to generalize better to other tasks since it eliminates the need of a module for tracking plan history, which would require different implementations for different task (we will test this in our future work).

    shows a failure case for another issue due to visual observations. We also provide the video for the entire episode in the supplementary material. Note in our experiments, the agent does not equip robot arms to open/close the door. Therefore, it only can go through open doors to move to other rooms. In this episode, the agent from most of the positions in the room cannot observe that the door is open (which connects to the other room which has the target object). The robot repeatedly tries to go towards the center of the room and refines the scene graph. However, it is still not able to identify the ”open” status for the door, for grounding LLMs to generate correct plans for navigating to the other room. Therefore, it fails to achieve the goal in the end.

   <p class="ltx_p" id="A5.p4.1">
    A better mechanism to verify attributes (open/close) associated with the object node (door) in the scene graph can help to alleviate this case. For example, the agent can move closer to the door, verify visual observations from all possible angles, and check the depth observation from the door compared to depth information from the wall (closed doors shall have nearly identical depths as the connected wall), and verify the visual observations from all possible angles. If the agent verifies and confirms the door is open, it can then go through the door to the other room.

    It will also be interesting to explore the possibility of using an open-source instruction-tuned LLM, such as Vicuna
