  <p class="ltx_p" id="id2.id1">
   Multi-agent systems driven by large language models (LLMs) have shown promising abilities for solving complex tasks in a collaborative manner. This work considers a fundamental problem in multi-agent collaboration: consensus seeking. When multiple agents work together, we are interested in how they can reach a consensus through inter-agent negotiation. To that end, this work studies a consensus-seeking task where the state of each agent is a numerical value and they negotiate with each other to reach a consensus value. It is revealed that when not explicitly directed on which strategy should be adopted, the LLM-driven agents primarily use the average strategy for consensus seeking although they may occasionally use some other strategies. Moreover, this work analyzes the impact of the agent number, agent personality, and network topology on the negotiation process. The findings reported in this work can potentially lay the foundations for understanding the behaviors of LLM-driven multi-agent systems for solving more complex tasks. Furthermore, LLM-driven consensus seeking is applied to a multi-robot aggregation task. This application demonstrates the potential of LLM-driven agents to achieve zero-shot autonomous planning for multi-robot collaboration tasks.

    </span>
    Our work considers a fundamental problem in multi-agent systems: consensus seeking. When multiple LLMs are used to solve the same task, they may have different solutions initially, but they can eventually reach the same solution through continuous negotiation. This is essentially a consensus-seeking process. Consensus seeking also widely exists in collective decision-making systems such as animal groups

     Research gap:
    </span>
    Consensus seeking via LLMs has not been well understood so far. There are many important questions that need to be answered. For instance, if we use multiple LLMs to assist us in negotiations or problem-solving, it is important for us to know whether they can eventually reach a consensus amongst themselves. If they can, how long would it take and what factors can influence the final consensus outcome? If they cannot, what factors may lead to this failure? The answers to these questions play a pivotal role in our proper utilization of LLMs. For example, it would be beneficial if we could predict the final negotiation outcome even before deploying LLMs or we know how to obtain desired negotiation outcomes by adjusting some prompts.

     Problem setup:
    </span>
    In this work, we study a specific consensus-seeking task. Specifically, in an LLM-driven multi-agent system, each agent starts with an initial state represented by a numerical value. The objective for them is to continuously adjust their states to achieve the same final state. Throughout this process, each agent can perceive the states of the other agents, and based on this information, formulate strategies to adjust their own states.

     Significance:
    </span>
    This consensus-seeking task is an abstraction of more complex tasks. Understanding this simple task can lay the necessary foundations for understanding more complex ones.
Specifically, in this task, the state of each agent corresponds to a point in the set of real numbers. In more complex tasks, the state of each agent may correspond to a point within a more complex set (e.g., a set of solutions).

This work reveals the similarity between the behavior exhibited by LLM-driven and ODE-driven multi-agent systems. The existing theoretical results of ODE-driven agents can provide a theoretical foundation to help us understand LLM-driven agents.

       A person’s personality often plays a significant role in negotiation and collaboration tasks. Motivated by this, we examined two types of personalities:

       . Compared to suggestible agents, stubborn agents tend to insist on their views and are less likely to change. We observed that stubborn agents have a dominant influence on the final consensus value of the group, leading the entire system to display a leader-follower structure.

        Impact of topology:
       </span>
       The flow of information in a multi-agent system corresponds to a network topology, which plays a pivotal role in negotiations. We examined several typical network topologies. For instance, when the network is fully connected, the exchange of information is most efficient, resulting in fast consensus convergence speed. When the network is not fully connected, the consensus convergence speed slows down. In the case of directed graphs, a leader-follower hierarchical structure emerges since some agents have a dominant influence on the final consensus outcome. In some systems, due to the interplay between personality and topology, consensus may not be reached, leading to clustering outcomes.

        Impact of agent number:
       </span>
       It is shown by Monte Carlo simulation that as the number of agents increases, the variance of the final consensus value decreases. This suggests that multiple agents can alleviate the randomness or hallucinations of the system so that a consistent outcome can be obtained in different trials. Moreover, while a small number of suggestible agents may cause oscillations of their states, a large number of them can suppress the occurrence of oscillations, suggesting that increasing the number of agents may stabilize group decision-making.

    The LLM-driven consensus seeking framework is further applied as a cooperative planner to a multi-robot aggregation task.

This application is important since it shows the potential of LLM-driven agents to achieve zero-shot autonomous task planning based on simple verbal commands.

    agents, at the initial moment, are randomly assigned a number between 0 to 100 as their state. This number can be thought of as the position of the agent in a one-dimensional space, or the index of a point in a more complex solution space. Through multiple rounds of inter-agent negotiation, the agents are expected to reach a consensus value.

    and explained as follows.
The initial prompt for each agent is the same apart from the difference in their initial states.
In each round, every agent must decide on a new state based on the information of the other agents’ states. The output of each agent in every round consists of two parts. The first part is “Reasoning”, which briefly explains the logic behind its decision. The second part is the “Position”, which represents the new state chosen by the agent. The introduction of reasoning is motivated by the Chain of Thought (CoT)

       The state of an agent can correspond to each agent’s thoughts, objectives, solutions, etc. In this paper, the state of an agent is a number, which can be thought of as an abstract state or the index of more complex quantities. If each agent represents a mobile robot, the number may correspond to the position of the robot on a one-dimensional straight line. In this context, consensus seeking corresponds to the

       Although we know quite a few strategies for consensus seeking among multiple agents, we avoid directly instructing the agents on which strategy to adopt and hope the agents autonomously select strategies. This is important because we may no longer know strategies for more complex tasks. It is essential for the agents to autonomously generate strategies.

        (a), agent 2 and agent 3 can receive information from agent 1, but agent 1 cannot receive information from agents 2 and 3. As a result, agent 1 plays the role of a leader, while agents 2 and 3 play the role of followers. Ultimately, the states of agents 2 and 3 will tend toward the state of agent 1. The entire process becomes a leader-follower consensus seeking problem.

        (b), agent 1 is the leader of agent 3, and agent 3 is the leader of agent 2. Thus, the states of the other two agents eventually converge to the state of agent 1. Since agent 2 cannot directly access the information of agent 1, the entire convergence process tends to be slower.

     , we believe the above observations for simple networks can generalize to a certain extent. Moreover, personality and topology can be combined. Then, the consensus process is jointly determined by the topology and the personality. There are still many other factors that may affect the consensus process, such as communication delays and weights assigned to different agents.

    In this section, we show how to apply LLM-driven consensus seeking in a multi-robot aggregation task, where multiple robots starting from different initial positions should converge to the same final position in the two-dimensional plane.

   Conclusion and Limitations
  </h2>
  <div class="ltx_para ltx_noindent" id="S6.p1">
   <p class="ltx_p" id="S6.p1.1">
    This work addresses the problem of consensus seeking, a core problem in collective decision-making. Our work reveals that multiple LLM-driven agents demonstrate considerate and cooperative personalities since they primarily use the average strategy for consensus seeking. The final consensus outcome is jointly affected by many factors such as agent personalities and network topology. It is also found that increasing the number of agents can alleviate the hallucinations of the system and may stabilize group decision-making. The findings obtained in this work can potentially lay the foundations for understanding the behaviors of LLM-driven multi-agent systems for collaboratively solving more complex tasks.
   </p>
  </div>
  <div class="ltx_para ltx_noindent" id="S6.p2">
   <p class="ltx_p" id="S6.p2.1">
    Some limitations of this work are summarized below. First, the state of each agent in this work is simply a numerical value. In more complex tasks, the state may correspond to a point in more intricate spaces (e.g., a sophisticated solution space for a task). In such cases, we believe that the conclusions drawn in this work can to some extent shed light on these more complex tasks. However, the degree to which these conclusions can be generalized still requires further investigation. Second, this work only considers one large language model, ChatGPT 3.5. Different models may employ slightly different strategies for consensus seeking. Lastly, when applied to multi-robot aggregation tasks, LLM-driven consensus seeking plays the role of a cooperative planner. However, the update rate of this planner is low. For high-performance multi-robot tasks, the planner should update at a higher frequency.

     Figure (a) illustrates a special scenario with 2 agents, where both agents have suggestible personalities, yet they might choose to remain stationary. In Figure (b), a special scenario with 10 agents is depicted, where even if the agents have stubborn personalities, they might still move to different positions to enhance the likelihood of completing the aggregation task.
