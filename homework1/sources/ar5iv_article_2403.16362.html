   Fault Localization (FL) is an essential step during the debugging process. With the strong capabilities of code comprehension, the recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising performance in diagnosing bugs in the code.
Nevertheless, due to LLMs’ limited performance in handling long contexts, existing LLM-based fault localization remains on localizing bugs within a
   <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="id2.id1.1">
    small code scope
   </span>
   (i.e., a method or a class), which struggles to diagnose bugs for a
   <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="id2.id1.2">

   , a multi-agent system based on ChatGPT for automated fault localization.
By simulating the behavior of a human developer,
   <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold ltx_font_smallcaps" id="id2.id1.4">
    AgentFL
   </span>
   models the FL task as a three-step process, which involves comprehension, navigation, and confirmation.
Within each step,
   <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold ltx_font_smallcaps" id="id2.id1.5">
    AgentFL
   </span>
   hires agents with diversified expertise, each of which utilizes different tools to handle specific tasks.
Particularly, we adopt a series of auxiliary strategies such as Test Behavior Tracking, Document-Guided Search, and Multi-Round Dialogue to overcome the challenges in each step.
The evaluation on the widely used Defects4J-V1.2.0 benchmark shows that
   <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold ltx_font_smallcaps" id="id2.id1.6">
    AgentFL
   </span>
   can localize 157 out of 395 bugs within Top-1, which outperforms the other LLM-based approaches and exhibits complementarity to the state-of-the-art learning-based techniques.
Additionally, we confirm the indispensability of the components in

    fine-tunes LLMs with adapters on the fault localization dataset (i.e., the tuning input are 128 consecutive code lines while the output are the buggy line labels).
Although showing promising effectiveness, existing techniques can only address a simplified fault localization scenario, i.e., localizing the buggy statements in the given buggy method.
The potential of LLMs under the project-level fault localization, i.e.,
    <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="S1.p2.1.3">
     localizing the buggy methods from an entire project
    </span>
    , has not been thoroughly studied, possibly due to the following technical challenges.
First, the codebase of a real-world project often contains millions of tokens, which are far beyond the maximum input length of existing LLMs (e.g., the input lengths of the GPT-3.5 series models vary from 4,096 to 16,385 tokens). Therefore, it is often infeasible and unacceptably resource-consuming to directly query LLMs with the entire project for fault localization.
Second, existing LLMs exhibit deteriorating performance as the length of input context increases and have a tendency to overlook critical information within the long inputs
    <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">
     [
     <a class="ltx_ref" href="#bib.bib17" title="">
      17
     </a>
     ]
    </cite>
    . Therefore, simply feeding LLMs with as much code as possible might not be an optimal way to leverage the superior capabilities of the model.

    To scale up LLM-based fault localization to the project-level contexts, in this work, we propose to decompose the localization process into multiple phases and selectively enhance LLMs with different debugging information during each phase. We are inspired by the debugging process of human developers, who often take various actions such as
    <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S1.p3.1.1">

Specifically, by decomposing the localization process into several steps and achieving FL through the collaboration of multiple LLM-driven agents (i.e., intelligent entities that can perceive the environment, make decisions, and perform actions), the advantages we expect are twofold.
On the one hand, this multi-step approach allows more controllable model inputs, which avoids excessively long contexts by merely providing essential information for the LLMs in each step.
On the other hand, the capabilities of LLMs are further exploited since each agent focuses on processing specific tasks with their customized expertise.

    , where each stage is driven by multiple specialized agents.
(1) The fault comprehension stage leverages LLMs to analyze the potential causes of the exposed fault, which would serve as the essential guidelines for the following two stages. Different from existing LLM-based FL techniques that only provide LLMs with the error message and the failed test code,

    </span>
    approach to collect the complete test execution behaviors (i.e., the test utility code) via lightweight program instrumentation.
(2) The codebase navigation stage then leverages LLMs to identify suspicious methods in a gradual refinement way, which first narrows down the faulty code space by finding out the suspicious classes and then selects related methods from these classes. To achieve this,

(3) The fault confirmation stage lastly leverages LLM to revisit all the suspicious methods (identified in the previous stage) and decide the most suspicious one as the final result. In this stage,

To achieve this, SBFL first collects coverage information for each program element

Our intuition is that compared to direct reasoning, the “understanding-reasoning” manner bridges the test failure information and the buggy source code with intermediate thought, which is more akin to the human mindset.

However, since the developers kept all the detailed test logic in test utility methods that are called by the test method, the LLMs may find it difficult to comprehend the complete test behavior through only the test method.
In particular, test utility methods are very prevalent in practice, e.g., each test method calls 4.93 other test utility methods on average in the Defect4J-V1.2.0 benchmark. Therefore, the information in the utility methods can be potentially helpful for comprehensively comprehending the test failure.

Our intuition is that given the test failure information and the possible causes generated from task ❷, ChatGPT can gradually browse the entire codebase from global to local and identify the program entities that may be responsible for the test failure.
Specifically, we start with two tasks for the

After that, the ❺

      Find Related Methods

      Challenge.
     </span>
     Nevertheless, the above design still faces three challenges: (1) Due to the possible invalidity or weakness of LLMs under long contexts
     <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">
      [
      <a class="ltx_ref" href="#bib.bib17" title="">
       17
      </a>
      ]
     </cite>
     , a strategy should be taken for leading the model to concentrate on critical information during the browsing process;
(2) An excessive number of covered classes can still result in LLM distraction and context length issues, for example, the failed integration test
     <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter" id="S3.SS3.p2.1.2">
      testSingletonGetter1
     </span>
     of bug Closure-36 covers hundreds of methods in 208 classes;
(3) The ChatGPT model struggles to identify related methods directly with the existing documents due to the absence of some method comments and the “function nested” problem.
The upper side of Figure
     <a class="ltx_ref" href="#S3.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ III-B Fault Comprehension ‣ III Approach ‣ AgentFL: Scaling LLM-based Fault Localization to Project-Level Context">
      <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">
       4
      </span>
     </a>
     shows an example of the original method comments in bug Closure-1.
In the first row, the absence of the comment of method
     <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter" id="S3.SS3.p2.1.3">
      isRemovableVar(Var)
     </span>
     prevents ChatGPT from better understanding its functionality.
In the second row, although the comment of
     <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter" id="S3.SS3.p2.1.4">
      process(Node,Node)
     </span>
     says it “
     <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S3.SS3.p2.1.5">
      removes all unused variables
     </span>
     ”, this method accomplishes the functionality by calling other methods.
We refer to this inconsistency of comment and function of a method as the “function nested” problem, which could mislead the LLMs to focus on irrelevant methods.
    </p>
   </div>
   <div class="ltx_para" id="S3.SS3.p3">
    <p class="ltx_p" id="S3.SS3.p3.1">
     <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="S3.SS3.p3.1.1">
      Strategy.
     </span>
     To alleviate the aforementioned challenges, we adopt a series of heuristic strategies:
(1) Considering that the LLMs can associate the function of a class/method with the function that may cause the bug through the proximity of natural language description, we adopt a
     <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="S3.SS3.p3.1.2">
      Document-Guided Search
     </span>
     strategy to first search for suspicious classes and then find the related methods.
Specifically, in task ❸, we extract the covered classes by source code analysis (Figure
     <a class="ltx_ref" href="#S3.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ III-B Fault Comprehension ‣ III Approach ‣ AgentFL: Scaling LLM-based Fault Localization to Project-Level Context">
      <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">
       3
      </span>
     </a>
     ), and prompt ChatGPT to select a single class from a markdown format table built with names and documentation of the covered classes.
After localizing the suspicious class, the ❺ task filters out all the methods that may relate to the bug according to the names and comments of the covered methods.
(2) To address the issue of an excessive number of covered classes, we draw inspiration from an observation in test coverage. Specifically, we have observed that the fixing behavior tends to occur more frequently in classes that exhibit higher method-level coverage (for further details, please refer to Section
     <a class="ltx_ref" href="#S4.SS4" title="IV-D Implementation ‣ IV Experiment Design ‣ AgentFL: Scaling LLM-based Fault Localization to Project-Level Context">
      <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">
       <span class="ltx_text">
        IV-D
       </span>
      </span>
     </a>
     ).
Based on this insight, we effectively mitigate the problem by selectively reducing the number of covered classes while ensuring that the performance remains unaffected, which is achieved by retaining only the Top-N classes that possess relatively high method-level coverage.
(3) For the documentation inconsistency, our insight is that as the LLMs have demonstrated powerful capabilities in code summarization
     <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">
      [
      <a class="ltx_ref" href="#bib.bib12" title="">

      <a class="ltx_ref" href="#bib.bib44" title="">

      ]

     , the
     <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S3.SS3.p3.1.3">
      Source Code Reviewer
     </span>
     agent can be hired to fix the problematic documentation.
Therefore, we further design the ❹
     <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S3.SS3.p3.1.4">
      Method Doc Enhancement
     </span>
     task to handle the above problem.
Before finding related methods, the source code and the original comments of all covered methods in the suspicious class are listed in the prompt, the agent is then required to analyze the method call relationship to generate a new comment for each method.
The enhanced documentation can be seen from the bottom side of Figure

      AgentFL
     </span>
     based on the Top-N (N=1,3,5) metric.
Top-N computes the number of bugs that have at least one buggy element localized within the first N positions in the ranked list.
It is easy to calculate the Top-1 value with the design of

However, since the ChatGPT model is a master at judging true or false rather than calculating suspicious values, it is non-trivial to get Top-3 and Top-5.
To alleviate the problem, we compromise by keeping a list of all the methods that
     <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps" id="S4.SS5.p1.1.4">

     However, when focusing on the results of individual projects, we find that
     <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps" id="S5.SS1.p4.1.1">
      AgentFL
     </span>
     has achieved competitive performance in all software projects except Closure.
To explain this, we scrutinized every bug that
     <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps" id="S5.SS1.p4.1.2">
      AgentFL
     </span>
     failed to localize while other approaches were able to make it.
We attribute the prominent weak effectiveness of
     <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps" id="S5.SS1.p4.1.3">
      AgentFL
     </span>
     on Closure to three aspects:
(1) Some bugs in Closure possess very similar characteristics.
For instance, bugs Closure-18 and Closure-31 have failed test cases with similar purposes (
     <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter" id="S5.SS1.p4.1.4">
      testDependencySorting
     </span>
     and
     <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter" id="S5.SS1.p4.1.5">
      testDependencySortingWhitespaceMode
     </span>
     ), and even the same buggy method
     <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter" id="S5.SS1.p4.1.6">
      parseInputs()
     </span>
     .
In these cases, the learning-based techniques learn much richer in-project knowledge than
     <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps" id="S5.SS1.p4.1.7">
      AgentFL
     </span>
     as they perform within-project prediction with the leave-one-out training strategy.
     <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps" id="S5.SS1.p4.1.8">
      AgentFL
     </span>
     , however, needs to localize a bug from scratch based on more generalized knowledge from ChatGPT.
(2) The tests in Closure tend to cover more program elements.
For example, the average number of classes covered by the bugs in Closure is 107.7, which is extremely larger than those in Lang (2.3) and Chart (27.5).
In this case, it is more difficult for
     <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps" id="S5.SS1.p4.1.9">
      AgentFL
     </span>
     to recognize the suspicious class at once among a large number of covered classes.
(3) Since
     <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps" id="S5.SS1.p4.1.10">
      AgentFL
     </span>
     is designed to validate rather than rank the methods, the number of suspicious methods in the result of
     <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps" id="S5.SS1.p4.1.11">
      AgentFL
     </span>
     is relatively small.
Among all 395 bugs, there are 319 (374) cases where the number of suspicious methods in the result is less than 3 (5).
Consequently, the increase in the number of bugs localized by
     <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps" id="S5.SS1.p4.1.12">
      AgentFL
     </span>
     becomes progressively smaller from Top-1 to Top-3 (157 to 183) and then Top-3 to Top-5 (183 to 187).

This indicates that it is a finer choice to offer ChatGPT time to think about the root causes of the test failure and take the analysis result as intermediate data to guide the subsequent localization process.
This pattern is more in line with the debugging behavior of developers and shares the idea of chain-of-thought

     declines marginally from 157 to 148 on the Top-1 metric.
To deeply understand the reasons for this phenomenon, we analyze the characteristics of utility methods corresponding to failed test cases.
We find that although each test method calls 4.93 other utility methods on average, these utility methods are generally shared by multiple test methods to handle common operations such as test initialization.
This means that the code of the test method may already carry most of the information needed by the ChatGPT to understand the behavior of the test.
Nonetheless, the fact of performance gain still emphasizes the potential of other sources of information than just the test code.

Two most significant breakthroughs occur in projects Math and Closure, where the numbers of localized bugs in terms of the Top-1 (Top-3) results are improved by 19 (8) and 29 (20), respectively.
To understand why participants achieved better localization results, we further investigate the cases where

      AgentFL
     </span>
     failed to suggest the buggy method at the top position.
The statistics show that in more than 80% of the cases, the number of incorrect predictions (i.e., non-buggy methods that are ranked before buggy methods) produced by

     in practice, we demonstrate two cases in Figure

In the first case,
     <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps" id="S5.SS3.p3.1.2">
      AgentFL
     </span>
     successfully understands the root cause of the bug Lang-42 (i.e., “did not escape the high unicode character correctly”).
However, although the method
     <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter" id="S5.SS3.p3.1.3">
      escapeHtml
     </span>
     has been mentioned in the bug report, the developer eventually modified its callee method

      escape

      escapeHtml
     </span>
     to handle with more specific character escaping logic) to fix the bug.
Similarly, in the second case,
     <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps" id="S5.SS3.p3.1.6">
      AgentFL
     </span>
     still failed to localize the buggy method, but it correctly interpreted the root cause of the bug Closure-1 and suggested the users to investigate the method
     <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter" id="S5.SS3.p3.1.7">
      interpretAssigns
     </span>
     , which is exactly the caller of the buggy method. As shown in the figure, the incorrect removal of unused variables happens in the method
     <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter" id="S5.SS3.p3.1.8">
      removeUnreferencedFunctionArgs

     , making it the buggy location.
For both cases,
     <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps" id="S5.SS3.p3.1.9">
      AgentFL
     </span>
     provides reasonable explanations despite its prediction (i.e., the caller methods of the buggy methods) is not exactly precise, which allows the user to

     on the often-concerned issues of prices and time consumption.
The results are demonstrated in Figure

     <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps" id="S6.SS1.p1.1.2">
      AgentFL
     </span>
     to completely deal with each bug, including test runs, program analysis, and ChatGPT inference.
For cost, we calculate how many dollars
     <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps" id="S6.SS1.p1.1.3">
      AgentFL
     </span>
     needs to localize each bug by multiplying the total number of consumed tokens with the model price (0.003 dollar per thousand tokens).
We observe that

      AgentFL
     </span>
     offers affordable cost in terms of time and money, which only takes an average of 0.074 dollars and 97 seconds to localize a fault.
In over 95% cases, the cost per bug would not exceed 0.2 dollars and 200 seconds.
Such a low expense is expected to mitigate the expensive costs that developers spend on FL.

      Internal.
     </span>
     The main internal threat comes from the data leakage problem.
As the training data of the
     <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S6.SS2.p1.1.2">
      gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613
     </span>
     model is up to Sep 2021 while Defects4J-V1.2.0 is released in Feb 2018, the fault localization dataset may have been used for model training.
We mitigate this threat by making sure that the input to ChatGPT does not include any content related to the project name, human-written bug report, or bug ID.
Moreover, the poor performance of the default ChatGPT (i.e., the baseline ChatGPT
     <sub class="ltx_sub" id="S6.SS2.p1.1.3">
      <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S6.SS2.p1.1.3.1">

     <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps" id="S6.SS2.p1.1.4">
      AgentFL

To address this, we evaluate

    Conclusion

  </h2>
  <div class="ltx_para" id="S7.p1">
   <p class="ltx_p" id="S7.p1.1">
    In this paper, we introduce
    <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps" id="S7.p1.1.1">
     AgentFL
    </span>
    , a multi-agent system based on ChatGPT for automated LLM-based FL.
Inspired by the human debugging actions,
    <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps" id="S7.p1.1.2">
     AgentFL
    </span>
    breaks the localization process into three steps (Fault Comprehension, Codebase Navigation, and Fault Confirmation), and hires several agents in each step to handle specific tasks.
The evaluation results on the Defects4J-V1.2.0 benchmark show that
    <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps" id="S7.p1.1.3">
     AgentFL
    </span>
    outperforms other LLM-based approaches and can be used complementarily to the existing learning-based techniques.
A user study also demonstrates the potential of
    <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps" id="S7.p1.1.4">
     AgentFL
    </span>
    in helping developers localize real-world software bugs.
Finally, the cost analysis shows that
    <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps" id="S7.p1.1.5">
     AgentFL
    </span>
    takes only an average of 0.074 dollars and 97 seconds to localize 157 out of 395 bugs within Top-1.
