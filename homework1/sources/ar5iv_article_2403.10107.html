   Abstract
  </h6>
  <p class="ltx_p" id="id12.id1">
   Human-centered dynamic scene understanding plays a pivotal role in enhancing the capability of robotic and autonomous systems, in which Video-based Human-Object Interaction (V-HOI) detection is a crucial task in semantic scene understanding, aimed at comprehensively understanding HOI relationships within a video to benefit the behavioral decisions of mobile robots and autonomous driving systems. Although previous V-HOI detection models have made significant strides in accurate detection on specific datasets, they still lack the general reasoning ability like human beings to effectively induce HOI relationships. In this study, we propose V-HOI Multi-LLMs Collaborated Reasoning (V-HOI MLCR), a novel framework consisting of a series of plug-and-play modules that could facilitate the performance of current V-HOI detection models by leveraging the strong reasoning ability of different off-the-shelf pre-trained large language models (LLMs). We design a two-stage collaboration system of different LLMs for the V-HOI task. Specifically, in the first stage, we design a Cross-Agents Reasoning scheme to leverage the LLM conduct reasoning from different aspects. In the second stage, we perform Multi-LLMs Debate to get the final reasoning answer based on the different knowledge in different LLMs. Additionally, we devise an auxiliary training strategy that utilizes CLIP, a large vision-language model to enhance the base V-HOI models’ discriminative ability to better cooperate with LLMs. We validate the superiority of our design by demonstrating its effectiveness in improving the prediction accuracy of the base V-HOI model via reasoning from multiple perspectives.

    Despite the great progress yielded for HOI relationship detection, most existing HOI detection models are unable to develop strong common-sense reasoning capabilities compared to human intelligence. Taking the example in Figure

    (a), the current SOTA V-HOI model gives the prediction ”a person is hugging the fruits”, but this does not obey the human common sense where ”a person is carrying the fruits” is more suitable. In Figure

     <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">

     </span>
    </a>
    (b), the model prediction is ”a person is riding the bike.” However, the action of ”riding” typically occurs when the person is on top of the bike. The example in the picture does not conform to this spatial relationship. In Figure

    (c), we show several consistent frames in a video, the initial model prediction is ”a person is riding a bike”, but in the following frame, the prediction is ”a person is leaning on the bike”, which is not rational when considering the fact consistency. From here, we could observe that, as trained only on specific datasets, current V-HOI models can have limited common sense reasoning ability, but it could lead to the interaction prediction being performed in better quality when equipped with our method, which aims at enhancing the model reasoning ability (right column). Recently, large language models (LLMs), which contain rich common sense knowledge

Also, as different large models are trained on different training corpus, they contain rich yet diverse knowledge. Inspired by the awesome reasoning ability of LLMs, we aim to investigate leveraging the strong reasoning ability of various LLMs to help the V-HOI task. In this work, we propose V-HOI

    Specifically, we construct the information of spatial layouts and temporal cues as structured instructions, which could enhance LLMs’ ability to ”imagine” object locations and the changes in the timeline from merely language prompts. Our design not only enables stable and consistent output structures but also strengthens LLMs’ understanding of the visual concepts of the spatial and temporal attribute value. Moreover, to effectively coordinate this diverse yet beneficial knowledge from different LLMs, we introduce a novel collaboration mechanism among Language Model (LLM) experts. Treating each LLM as a reasoning expert, we implement a two-stage collaboration scheme. In the first stage, our Cross-Agents Reasoning scheme assigns distinct roles to different agents within an LLM, focusing on spatial rationality and temporal consistency reasoning. In the second stage, a cyclic debate mechanism is employed to assess and aggregate responses from various LLMs, enabling the deduction of final answers based on comprehensive knowledge from all LLMs.

    Method Overview. Upon the analysis of video sequences, we initially apply the state-of-the-art models for V-HOI detection to obtain preliminary prediction triplets for individual frames. These triplets are then converted into textual form and processed through our LLMs collaborative framework. Our framework operates in two primary stages: the first stage is Cross-Agents Reasoning, where various distinct agents are established within each different LLM (ChatGPT, LLaMA2, and PaLM2) to evaluate the logic of the predictions from different perspectives, including spatial and temporal coherence. The second stage is the Multi-LLMs Debate, where we integrate responses from various LLMs in a debate-style format to refine and finalize the predictions.

     utilizes language models to produce spatial arrangements, thereby demonstrating the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in visual planning. Although previous V-HOI detection models have achieved notable improvements in improving detection accuracy on certain datasets, they still fall short of human-like reasoning abilities to effectively induce human-object interaction relationships, hampered by the biased knowledge obtained from specific training datasets. Hence, LLMs can aid with this through their reasoning capability.

    We employ each LLM (e.g. ChatGPT) as a cross-aspect reasoning agent to enhance the accuracy of predictions derived from current V-HOI detection models. Within this framework, we have architected three specialized reasoning agents—those that apply (a)common sense, (b)spatial reasoning, and (c)temporal reasoning to refine the predictions yielded by the extant V-HOI detection model.

    Benefiting from the large corpus and ample computing resources, LLMs achieve outstanding understanding performance in most natural language processing (NLP) tasks via incredible reasoning ability. Inspired by it, we aim to excavate the common sense, spatial, and temporal reasoning abilities of LLMs to facilitate the V-HOI task. To this end, we utilize each LLM as a cross-aspect reasoning agent to get more accurate predictions of existing V-HOI detection models. We give an overview of the Cross-Agents Reasoning process in Figure

For each agent, we prompted it to evaluate current HOI predictions. Each prompt includes a task description (Instruction) but with different roles to focus on different aspects when answering the question, a few examples (Demonstrations) that users carefully design, and a test instance (Test).

     Besides the basic common sense reasoning ability of LLMs, enabling LLMs to understand the spatial correlations between the subjects and objects is also vital. As the input to LLM is only text, to incorporate the spatial information into the input, we involve another attribute of the subject and object when asking the LLM: The position (bounding boxes) of the subject and object, which explicitly gives the spatial locations at a video frame.

     To this end, there are two stages of our spatial reasoning assistant: 1) we ask LLMs if the predicted action in the triplet is spatial-aware. 2) we ask the assistant to give scores for example whether the predicted action is rational, based on the given subject and object locations. The task description (Instruction), examples (Demonstrations), and test instances (Test) are illustrated in Figure

    In our method, instead of only using one LLM to improve the prediction accuracy, we use several different LLMs to fully leverage the different knowledge. However, reasoning from the LLM sometimes gets incorrect answers, and some recent studies

     dataset emerges as the largest compilation of video data featuring comprehensive HOI annotations so far, which aggregates videos depicting unscripted human activities in dynamic, unstructured environments, sourced from social media—effectively portraying genuine real-world scenarios. This dataset encompasses 7122 videos, 78 object categories, and 50 relation classes including action and spatial relations. Note that half of the relation classes pertain to temporal relationships. It supplies 755K HOI instances and the most annotated keyframes (7.3M in total), and also defines the most HOI categories (557 in total) in the existing video datasets.

     . As shown, compared to state-of-the-art methods that we use as the baseline methods, the equipment of our MLCR method achieves superior performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of our framework. It is worth noting that even if only the common sense agent and debate scheme are applied, our V-HOI MLCR framework still obtains a huge performance gain compared to the two baseline models on the AG dataset under the metric R@50, respectively 13.87% for STTran with MLCR and 13.47% for STTranGaze with MLCR. Meanwhile, the MLCR framework still shows promising performance when faced with the more complex multi-person scenario VidHOI dataset, the largest boosts continue to be seen in the R@50 metric, at 7.79% for STTran with MLCR and 7.01% for STTranGaze with MLCR, respectively. On the remaining metrics, the MLCR shows different levels of enhancement to the baseline models, which proves that the common sense, spatial-temporal corrections made by the MLCR to the predictions made by the baseline model using its powerful inference capabilities are reasonable and effective.

     also shows the effectiveness of the common sense agent, spatial agent, and temporal agent. We could observe that as the three agent modules are added in turn, the performance of the baseline model progressively increases and is reflected in all evaluation metrics. Ultimately, the evaluation of the multi-LLMs debate scheme is still shown in Table

     . It could be observed that the debate mechanism can continue to robustly improve the performance of the MLCR framework, suggesting that this scheme makes the LLMs’ answers more reasonable and their reasoning better.

     As we expected, different components of our framework all facilitate performance improvement. This further illustrates that the MLCR architecture has more outstanding common sense and spatio-temporal reasoning capabilities to effectively correct for biases and erroneous predictions of baseline models that have been trained on specific datasets.

     , our framework succeeds in correctly predicting relationships containing spatio-temporal information (e.g ”watch”, ”hold”, ”next to”) through the inference of LLMs, which pulls the score of the triplet up making it higher than the threshold, thus allowing the correct triplet to be accurately admitted.

    In this paper, we have proposed a novel framework V-HOI MLCR for Human-Centered Dynamic Scene Understanding. Specifically, we collaborate the existing V-HOI models with LLMs as external experts to facilitate their reasoning abilities and propose an auxiliary training scheme with CLIP to enhance baseline models. Our proposed framework is simple yet effective and can be used conveniently in a plug-and-play manner. Our framework achieves superior performance on the Action Genome dataset and the VidHOI dataset.
