   Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited notable efficacy in question-answering (QA) tasks across diverse domains. Their prowess in integrating extensive web knowledge has fueled interest in developing LLM-based autonomous agents. While LLMs are efficient in decoding human instructions and deriving solutions by holistically processing historical inputs, transitioning to purpose-driven agents requires a supplementary rational architecture to process multi-source information, establish reasoning chains, and prioritize critical tasks. Addressing this, we introduce
   <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps" id="id13.id1.1">
    FinMem
   </span>
   , a novel LLM-based agent framework devised for financial decision-making. It encompasses three core modules: Profiling, to customize the agent’s characteristics; Memory, with layered message processing, to aid the agent in assimilating hierarchical financial data; and Decision-making, to convert insights gained from memories into investment decisions. Notably,
   <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps" id="id13.id1.2">
    FinMem
   </span>
   ’s memory module aligns closely with the cognitive structure of human traders, offering robust interpretability and real-time tuning. Its adjustable cognitive span allows for the retention of critical information beyond human perceptual limits, thereby enhancing trading outcomes. This framework enables the agent to self-evolve its professional knowledge, react agilely to new investment cues, and continuously refine trading decisions in the volatile financial environment. We first compare
   <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps" id="id13.id1.3">
    FinMem
   </span>
   with various algorithmic agents on a scalable real-world financial dataset, underscoring its leading trading performance in stocks. We then fine-tuned the agent’s perceptual span and character setting to achieve a significantly enhanced trading performance. Collectively,
   <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps" id="id13.id1.4">

    With the influx of diverse financial data streams from the web, traders face a deluge of information from various sources. This requires them rapidly to understand, memorize, and filtrate crucial events for investment decisions. However, innate cognitive limitations restrict human traders from processing information within their perception and memory capacity, a span much narrower than the actual volume of available information
    <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">

    </cite>
    . Consequently, insufficiently considering or even dismissing critical events affecting trading decisions becomes increasingly concerning as data availability expands. To overcome the physical limitations in the memory systems of human traders, researchers have been consistently working on designing autonomous trading agent systems. These systems need to thoroughly integrate all available information and possess a sophisticated design in the agent’s backbone algorithm to deliver enhanced trading performance.

    as backbone algorithms, garner joint attention of both academia and industry. Leveraging both RL principles and deep learning, DRL agents effectively handle and learn from scalable and diverse financial data, including stock prices, key financial indicators, and market sentiments. They utilize deep neural networks to extract expressive features from input data, representing the complex financial market environment, which enhances their comprehension ability. Retaining the key features of RL agents, they learn through interaction with a predefined environment to maximize investment gain over time. Research suggests DRLs can meet the crucial needs of trading agents to process and make informed decisions from large volumes of data. However, certain inherent features of DRL algorithms exhibit notable deficiencies in financial applications.
    <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="S1.p2.1.1">
     Firstly, DRL agents exhibit a lack of interpretability concerning the rationale behind their decisions
     <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">

    </span>
    They are often described as “black boxes,” where the internal processes and computational layers leading to a specific decision are neither easily understandable nor transparent.
    <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="S1.p2.1.2">
     Secondly, DRL agents find it challenging to effectively integrate textual data with numerical features.
    </span>
    Text data plays a vital role in finance, since the majority of market information is conveyed through news articles and financial reports. However, transforming text data to embeddings considerably increases input space dimensionality, making learning more computationally demanding. Plus, empirical studies have shown that combining textual representations with numerical financial indicators often leads to convergence challenges
    <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">

    , offer viable solutions for developing trading agents, alleviating previous concerns. With carefully designed prompts, the LLM-based agent is able to provide reasons and outcomes in plain text. This allows for immediate observation and prompt adjustment of its reasoning process. Employing LLMs as the backbone algorithms for agents also overcomes the constraint of isolated environments. This is achieved through their vast pre-existing knowledge and the effective integration of valuable insights from a variety of data sources, including both textual and numerical. When equipped with suitable prompt templates, this approach significantly enhances decision-making capabilities

    . However, in currently available approaches, LLMs primarily serve as a QA role rather than functioning as autonomous agents.
    <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="S1.p3.1.1">
     The potential issue with these approaches is the incapability of fully understanding the varying timeliness associated with different types of financial data.
    </span>
    These financial LLM agents, despite outperforming traditional trading benchmarks, generally process information indiscriminately through QA iterations, lacking the ability to memorize influential messages. Furthermore, their method of acknowledging the timeliness of financial data is heavily dependent on the uncertain and laborious LLM fine-tuning process. These insufficiencies undermine their ability to update the knowledge base in a daily manner, meaning they lack a memory component. As a result, they may struggle to prioritize significant and influential memory events effectively. Additionally, current literature on LLM-based trading agents lacks a comparative analysis between these applications and other autonomous trading systems, such as DRL agents.

     The development of trading agents has evolved over several decades, influenced by advancements in technology, finance, and computational methodologies. Conventionally, a rule-based algorithm for trading stocks is an automated strategy that operates based on a predefined set of rules

      but with modified recency and importance computations, especially tailoring to handle data with various timelines. It encapsulates three metrics: recency, relevancy, and importance. Individual metric scores exceeding 1.0 are scaled to the [0,1] range before being summed. The modification is to achieve the layered processing function and represent the various periodicity of the financial environment.

      partially controls memory decay rates across layers, indicating longer memory persistence in the long-term layer with a higher stability value. In the context of trading, company annual reports, such as Form 10-Ks, are considered to have more extended timeliness compared to daily financial news. Therefore, they are assigned a higher stability value and are categorized within the deeper processing layer. This classification reflects their extended relevance and impact in financial decision-making scenarios.

This agent’s architecture includes a memory module that employs recency, relevance, and importance metrics to extract pivotal memory events for informed decision-making. However, it does not provide a layered memory module to effectively differentiate the time sensitivities unique to various types of financial data. Additionally, although it features a profiling module to define agent attributes like professional background, the model does not include a mechanism for self-adaptive risk preference. In our experiments, we modified the original prompt template created by Park et al., which was intended for general daily tasks, to suit financial investment tasks. The textual elements of this revised template closely align with those of

The effectiveness of different investment strategies is evaluated based on their Cumulative Returns, which reflect the total change in value over time.

        . This metric adjusts returns for risk, with a higher ratio indicating better risk-adjusted performance. Essential in comparing different portfolios or strategies, it contextualizes performance against similar investments. Although a Sharpe Ratio above 1 is typically considered favorable and above 2 as excellent, these benchmarks can vary depending on the context of comparison.

     employs GPT-4-Turbo as its backbone algorithm. The temperature parameter of the model was set at 0.7 to maintain a balance between response content consistency and model creativity. It was trained on financial data from August 17, 2021, to October 05, 2022, and underwent testing with data from October 06, 2022, to April 10, 2023.

The testing period was kept consistent with the other models. The DRL algorithms were implemented using Stable Baselines 3

      FinMem

     switches to an optimistic and assertive approach, thus avoiding excessive passivity. This self-adaptive risk inclination proved effective for most stocks, apart from MSFT as shown in Table

These studies concentrated on the backbone algorithm, the memory module’s cognitive capacity, and the character setting in the profiling module, particularly examining the aspect of risk inclination. These studies were done using the stock of Tesla, Inc., with a more compact training period from March 14, 2022, to June 15, 2022, and a testing period from June 16, 2022, to December 28, 2022. This shorter duration was chosen for budgetary efficiency, yet it remains sufficient to differentiate the functionality of each component.

     , both models defaulted to a “Hold” strategy beyond a certain point during periods of intense fluctuation in TSLA stock. The unsatisfactory performance of davinci-003 may be attributed to its limited capability, as an earlier generation language model, to capture and understand nuanced yet decisive information.

     . Nonetheless, in the context of stock trading, it still demonstrated challenges in adequately comprehending key messages necessary for effective trading decisions. The comparatively poorer performance of Llama2-70b-chat can also be attributed to its shorter context window, especially when compared to the GPT models. When integrated with

This approach resulted in a Cumulative Return trajectory that generally lagged behind the market baseline, reflecting a degree of overcaution that limited trading activity and potential gains, particularly in a bullish market.
