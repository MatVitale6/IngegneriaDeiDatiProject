   Abstract
  </h6>
  <p class="ltx_p" id="id7.id1">
   Benefiting from the powerful capabilities of large language models (LLMs), agents based on LLMs have shown the potential to address domain-specific tasks and emulate human behaviors. However, the content generated by these agents remains somewhat superficial, owing to their limited domain expertise and the absence of an effective cognitive architecture. To address this, we present the Configurable General Multi-Agent Interaction (CGMI) framework, designed to replicate human interactions in real-world scenarios. Specifically, we propose a tree-structured methodology for the assignment, detection, and maintenance of agent personality. Additionally, we designed a cognitive architecture equipped with a skill library based on the ACT* model, which contains memory, reflection, and planning modules. We have also integrated general agents to augment the virtual environment’s realism. Using the CGMI framework, we simulated numerous classroom interactions between teacher and students. The experiments indicate that aspects such as the teaching methodology, curriculum, and student performance closely mirror real classroom settings. We will open source our work.

However, when using LLMs to complete ABSS tasks, the following issues need to be addressed: (1) How to trigger the capabilities of LLMs to solve complex problems? (2) How to ensure that agents have a stable role and behavior output based on LLMs without forgetting? (3) How to design a communication mechanism for LLMs-based agents to truly simulate interactions?

    . Although LLMs like GPT4 possess strong role-playing capabilities, we found that LLMs tend to forget the original character settings in multi-turn dialogues and make decisions that are inconsistent with the character’s design. Additionally, due to the limitations of the context window, it’s challenging to set roles comprehensively and in fine detail. To address these issues, this paper introduces a tree-structured persona model for character assignment, detection, and maintenance, which is beneficial for agent interaction performance.

     Based on CGMI, a classroom teaching scenario is constructed. This scenario includes 3 general intelligent agents (teaching assistant agent, teaching process supervisor agent, consistency checker agent) and 6 role agents (teacher Mrs. Smith, student Ying Zheng, student Emily, student John, student Ryan and student Samantha). After the user inputs the course topic, the virtual classroom teaching scenario launches. The teaching assistant agent generates corresponding teaching plans and distributes them to Mrs. Smith and the teaching process supervisor agent. Mrs. Smith divides the teaching process into stages according to the plan. The teaching process supervisor agent monitors whether the current stage has ended and decide whether to enter the next stage. Before each role agent’s statement, the consistency checker agent detects and maintains consistency between its personality and statement content. When Mrs. Smith asks the class questions, the consistency checker agent judges each student’s willingness to answer based on personality and classroom status, simulating real hand-raising.

     This random testing method is not only efficient and comprehensive but also saves contextual window resources. Multi-level testing can avoid the illusion of unchanged coarse-grained personality due to changes in fine-grained personality. This method can also be applied to other related character scales, as detailed in Appendix.

     This proliferation necessitates an advanced cognitive architecture to process the burgeoning data. However, the current cognitive architecture embedded in LLMs-based agents can only allow agents to plan and reflect in a linear fashion, reminiscent of an assembly line. To redress this shortfall, this paper introduces the cognitive architecture infused with a domain-specific skill library, rooted in the Adaptive Control of Thought (ACT*) paradigm

    Configurable General Multi-Agent Interaction Framework

     With the support of structured persona models and enhanced cognitive models with skill libraries, a single agent can play multiple roles in specific scenarios to complete complex tasks. However, currently, using LLMs-based agents to achieve preset goals in specific tasks often fails to present real social interactions, because simulating social phenomena requires multiple Agents to interact and cooperate in a human-like manner. Therefore, this paper introduces the Configurable General Multi-Agent Interaction Framework (CGMI) that can simulate real interactions.

     In the context of classroom teaching, this paper explores how CGMI promotes interaction and collaboration among multiple agents. In addition to virtual teacher Agent and virtual student Agents, we have also designed assistant Agents responsible for setting educational goals, planning teaching schedules, and analyzing students’ willingness to speak to support teacher’s teaching activities. These assistant Agents can adjust their functional configurations based on specific scenarios. To ensure the quality of the interaction process, we introduced a supervisory Agent responsible for detecting ”personality forgetting”, ensuring that the ”teacher Agent proceeds with teaching as planned”, and ”determining when to end the discussion”. Through the CGMI framework, each intelligent entity can engage in more in-depth personalized dialogues and task completion, collaboratively creating a realistic virtual teaching environment.

     , teachers can teach more effectively, and the interaction between teachers and students is more targeted, without deviating from the topic. During the questioning session, the supervisory Agent selects the most suitable student to ask questions based on the student’s cognitive analysis of their willingness to speak. The supervisory Agent also monitors the persona status of the intelligent agents in real-time and maintains it if there’s any deviation. Users can also operate the supervisory Agent to adjust the classroom process according to their needs.

    In this section, we first present the ”classroom teaching scenario” reconstructed using the CGMI framework and analyze the teaching behaviors during the class. Subsequently, through comparative experiments, we showcase the behavioral advantages of agents equipped with human intrinsic traits (such as personality, cognitive structures, etc.). Lastly, we analyze the significance of generic intelligent agents in enhancing the interaction logic of role-specific agents.
In our experiment, we adopted OpenAI’s gpt-3.5-turbo-16k model

     We employed the Flanders Interaction Analysis System (FIAS) to examine interactive behaviors between teachers and students across three virtual classroom sessions. We hired 2 trained experts to encode the teaching behaviors. These two encoders worked independently, encoding each sentence once and sequentially constructing a behavior sequence, ultimately achieving consistent evaluation results. These sessions focused on the following topics: C1: Concept of the Quadratic Equation, C2: Methods for Solving the Quadratic Equation, and C3: Applications of the Quadratic Equation.

     , teacher’s behavior(B1, B2, B3, B4, B5, B6, B7) made up an average of 61.23% of the discourse in these mathematics sessions. In contrast, students’ behavior(B8, B9) facilitated by teacher prompts represented an average of 23.53%. Notably, the ratio of indirect influence behaviors (B1, B2, B3, B4) to direct influence behaviors (B5, B6, B7) remained below 1. This suggests that the virtual classroom is dominated by teachers who have direct control over the overall classroom. Furthermore, student-initiated interactions constituted about 15.23%, suggesting that students remain engaged, deliberating, and responding to queries under the teacher’s guidance.

    Intrinsic Characteristics of Intelligent Agents

   <div class="ltx_para" id="Sx4.SSx2.p1">
    <p class="ltx_p" id="Sx4.SSx2.p1.1">
     To assess the efficacy of the proposed cognitive architecture, we examined it through the lens of a teacher, Mrs. Smith, analyzing her classroom practices and her subsequent reflections and plans. As illustrated in Figure 4, we displayed the part of her reflective and planning processes within a single lesson and across two different lessons. Our analysis sought to elucidate the influence of the cognitive structure on agents, emphasizing the model’s capacity for both reflection and planning. We analyzed the effectiveness of the algorithm from within and between classes.

     <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="Sx4.SSx2.p2.1.2">
      I’m really nervous about this lesson.
     </span>
     ” Mrs. Smith, attuned to this feedback, incorporated it into her reflective process and instructional planning. Drawing from a library of teaching techniques, she employed strategies such as heightened encouragement and gamified instructional methods. A parallel observation was made in Course-TWO and Course-THREE. Mrs. Smith prompted students to consider, “
     <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="Sx4.SSx2.p2.1.3">
      How do coefficients ’b’ and ’c’ affect the graph of a quadratic function?
     </span>

      (2) Between lessons
     </span>
     : Across different courses, the proposed cognitive structure is still valid. It plays a crucial role in refining Mrs. Smith’s teaching focus, deepening understanding and adapting teaching methods. For example, through reflection on Course-ONE, Mrs Smith found that Emily exhibited anxiety when faced with mathematical challenges. This insight directly influenced Mrs.Smith reassuring statement to Emily in Course-TWO: ”
     <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="Sx4.SSx2.p3.1.2">
      I’m pleased to see you’ve overcome your apprehension towards mathematics.

      The effect of tree-structured persona model.
     </span>
     To discern whether agents with varied personality traits exhibit distinguishable behaviors during interactions, we executed a comparative study depicted in Figure 5. One lesson involved personality allocation, detection, and maintenance, whereas the other lacked any defined agent personalities. In the absence of assigned traits, there was a notable uniformity in the expressions of five students, often resorting to statements like, ”
     <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="Sx4.SSx2.p4.1.2">
      I’m excited…
     </span>
     ”. In contrast, once unique personality traits were allocated, their expressions became more nuanced and aligned with their respective personas. For instance, the outgoing Ryan would suggest a “
     <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="Sx4.SSx2.p4.1.3">
      discussion with classmates
     </span>
     ”, while the industrious Ying Zheng would exude a “

   <div class="ltx_para" id="Sx4.SSx2.p5">
    <p class="ltx_p" id="Sx4.SSx2.p5.1">
     Furthermore, on the right side of Figure 5, the statements made by the student Emily throughout the class are displayed. Judging from the records of her remarks, the Emily Agent has demonstrated a consistent persona, interacting with teachers and classmates based on the previously established persona. In detail, she remarked, “
     <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="Sx4.SSx2.p5.1.1">
      I’m considerably anxious about this quadratic equations segment.
     </span>
     ” at the start of the class. In the middle part of the course, she still showed her unfamiliarity and lack of confidence in the current knowledge in the interaction, expressing like, ”
     <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="Sx4.SSx2.p5.1.2">
      I’m not well-versed with quadratic equations, yet I’m keen on learning and exploring various aspects…
     </span>
     ”, and “
     <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="Sx4.SSx2.p5.1.3">
      Being an average student, I might require a while to fully comprehend quadratic equations
     </span>
     ”.

     By imbuing agents with human-like qualities, they can adeptly distill insights from evolving scenarios and exhibit individualized responses. In addition, it also can make agents recalibrate actions based on accumulated knowledge and abilities. This significantly augments agents’ adaptive capabilities in multifaceted environments. Concurrently, the tree-structured character model introduced in this study effectively and efficiently captures and retains the personalized data of agents.

     , when the teacher posed the question to all students: ”
     <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="Sx4.SSx3.p2.1.2">
      Can anyone tell me the general form of a quadratic function?
     </span>
     ”, the outcomes differed between the answer willingness judgment agent and random selection methods. The former showed the students’ willingness to answer intensity: John: 3, Emily: 5, Ryan: 4, Samantha: 2, Ying Zheng: 4. Notably, the students’ willingness strength is highly consistent with their character traits. For instance, the expressive Emily exhibited high willingness to answer, while the introverted Samantha showed less. The random selection method, however, produced different results.

     , it can be seen that the answer willingness judgment agent, considering factors like students’ personalities, classroom dynamics, and their grasp of the subject, recommended John 4 times, Emily 9 times, Ryan 6 times, Samantha 1 time, and Ying Zheng 8 times. However, with random selection, the results were John 7 times, Emily 3 times, Ryan 4 times, Samantha 6 times, and Ying Zheng 8 times. The expressive Emily only volunteered to answer 3 times, significantly undermining the rationality of the interaction process between the teacher and students in the virtual scenario.

     In addition to posing questions to all students, teachers also selectively direct questions to specific students.

     In summary, the flexible interaction logic setting ensures that the interaction process among multiple agents is no longer a random choice without considering the actual situation and role settings, nor a process where every role needs to be expressed. This introduces more possibilities for virtual scenarios.

    This paper introduces a multi-agent interaction framework (CGMI) that supports personalized configurations, enabling multiple agents to engage in anthropomorphic interactions and collaborations. It also can simulate domain-specific social phenomena. We designed a cognitive architecture equipped with domain skill library. It allows agents to combine domain knowledge for reflection and planning, and condense the working memory into declarative and procedural memories. With the assistance of general agents, the authenticity of scenarios can be further enhanced. Moreover, we employed a virtual ”classroom teaching” scenario to simulate the teaching process between teachers and students, and conducted comparative analysis of their interaction content and logic, verifying the effectiveness of CGMI.

  </div>
  <div class="ltx_para" id="Sx5.p2">
   <p class="ltx_p" id="Sx5.p2.1">
    In the future, we hope that the social scenarios simulated by multiple agents will not only provide users with valuable social experimental data, aiding the development of large models, but also support industrial applications, such as assisting teaching and gamified teaching.

     Mrs. Smith’s teaching style can be described by Sternberg Thinking Styles in Teaching Inventory with a tree-structured format (Figure 14). Each Level-2 node has its score, representing the degree of match between the description provided and the actual teaching style, with a maximum of 7 and a minimum of 1. Each Level-1 node also has its corresponding score, which is the sum of the scores of all its child nodes. The higher the value, the higher the degree of matching.
