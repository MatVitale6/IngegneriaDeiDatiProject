   Abstract
  </h6>
  <p class="ltx_p" id="id1.id1">
   Recently, advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 have been integrated into many real-world applications like Code Copilot.
These applications have significantly expanded the attack surface of LLMs, exposing them to a variety of threats.
Among them, jailbreak attacks that induce toxic responses through carefully constructed jailbreak prompts have raised critical safety concerns.
To effectively identify these threats, a growing number of red team approaches simulate potential adversarial scenarios by crafting jailbreak prompts to test the target LLM.
However, existing red teaming methods do not consider the unique vulnerabilities of LLM in different scenarios (e.g., code-related tasks), making it difficult to adjust the jailbreak prompts to find context-specific vulnerabilities, thereby lacking efficiency.
Meanwhile, these methods are limited to refining handcrafted jailbreak templates using a few mutation operations (such as synonym replacement), lacking the automation and scalability to continuously adapt to different scenarios.
To enable context-aware and efficient red teaming, we abstract and model existing attacks into a coherent concept called “jailbreak strategy” and propose a multi-agent LLM system named RedAgent that leverages these strategies to generate context-aware jailbreak prompts.
By self-reflecting on contextual feedback and red teaming trials in an additional memory buffer, RedAgent continuously learns how to leverage these strategies to achieve more effective jailbreaks in specific contexts.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our system can jailbreak most black-box LLMs within just five queries, improving the efficiency of existing red teaming methods by two times.
Additionally, RedAgent can jailbreak customized LLM applications more efficiently. By generating context-aware jailbreak prompts towards trending applications on GPTs, we discover 60 severe vulnerabilities of these real-world applications with only two queries per vulnerability. We have reported all found issues and communicated with OpenAI and Meta for bug fixes.
Furthermore, our results indicate that LLM applications enhanced with external data or tools are more vulnerable to jailbreak attacks than foundation models.

    that focus on creating jailbreak prompts to elicit harmful responses from the target LLM, simulating potential adversarial scenarios in a black-box setting.
Typically, given a malicious goal to jailbreak (e.g., generate violent content in a video script), a red teaming method first requires human effort to craft specific jailbreak templates (i.e., human red team), such as the early well-known ‘DAN’ Jailbreak template
    <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">
     [
     <a class="ltx_ref" href="#bib.bib2" title="">

    further leverage an LLM to refine (e.g., syntax transformation and synonym replacement) these human-crafted templates as jailbreak prompts to query the target LLM.
These prompts are iteratively refined based on the target LLM’s responses to increase their effectiveness, as demonstrated in Figure
    <a class="ltx_ref" href="#S1.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ I Introduction ‣ RedAgent: Red Teaming Large Language Models with Context-aware Autonomous Language Agent">

  <div class="ltx_para" id="S1.p3">
   <p class="ltx_p" id="S1.p3.1">
    However, existing red teaming methods are difficult to overcome the following challenges:
1) Lack of high-quality jailbreak prompts: While existing work can generate thousands of prompts in minutes, we found that these prompts are often ineffective when jailbreaking LLM applications.
This is because specific LLM applications are often fine-tuned or prompted with additional data, resulting in different unique weaknesses.
However, such uniqueness is hard to perceive due to the complexity of feedback of the target LLM.
Therefore, generating jailbreak prompts adapted to the specific “context” of LLM is an important but non-trival objective for red teaming methods.
As shown in Figure
    <a class="ltx_ref" href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ RedAgent: Red Teaming Large Language Models with Context-aware Autonomous Language Agent">
     <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">
      1
     </span>
    </a>
    , when jailbreaking the customized LLM
    <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">
     [
     <a class="ltx_ref" href="#bib.bib41" title="">
      41
     </a>
     ]
    </cite>
    on the OpenAI marketplace, the context-aware jailbreak prompts are of higher quality than the generic jailbreak prompts, as evidenced by the more harmful responses.
2) Lack of automation and scalability:
These red teaming approaches are limited to using a few mutation operations (e.g. synonym replacement and character splitting) to refine handcrafted jailbreak templates.
This limitation of the action space further restricts the automation and scalability of the generated prompts.
Meanwhile, due to the long textual length of LLM responses, existing red teaming methods only store a small number of interactions with the target model (e.g., 6 trials), which is inefficient when constant contextual adjustments are needed to find unique weaknesses of the target LLM.
Therefore, it is difficult but important to automatically equip “learning” mechanisms to continuously gain longer-term insights from history.
   </p>
  </div>
  <div class="ltx_para" id="S1.p4">
   <p class="ltx_p" id="S1.p4.1">
    To address the first challenge, we propose a novel “context-aware” prompt generation technique to capture the context information of different LLM models and applications.
To achieve this, we automatically construct context-aware malicious goals and self-reflect on model’s feedback to guide the generation of context-aware jailbreak prompts.
To address the second challenge, we propose to abstract and model existing jailbreak attacks into a unified framework called “jailbreak strategy” and equip red teaming methods with “learning” mechanisms by updating their understanding of it.
By integrating the above two designs, we propose an automated and efficient red teaming approach named RedAgent,
which leverages the abstracted strategies to generate context-aware jailbreak prompts. By self-reflecting on contextual feedback and trials in an additional memory buffer named Skill Memory (as shown in Figure
    <a class="ltx_ref" href="#S3.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ III RedAgent ‣ RedAgent: Red Teaming Large Language Models with Context-aware Autonomous Language Agent">
     <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">
      3
     </span>
    </a>
    ), RedAgent continuously learns how to leverage these strategies to achieve more effective jailbreaks in specific contexts.
We further expand the action space of existing red teaming methods into five kind of actions and let our system autonomously determine the actions to enhance the automation and scalability of itself.
Specifically, we use four individual LLMs to implement the agentic system, and the overall process consists of three stages:
1) In the Context-aware Profiling Stage, we probe the target LLM to determine the application scope, which is then used to craft a context-aware malicious goal.
2) Given the crafted malicious goal, in the stage of Adaptive Jailbreak Planning, the planner retrieves effective strategies and formulates an attack plan consisting of jailbreak strategies and corresponding guidance based on the understanding of previous experiences stored in the Skill Memory.
3) In the Attacking and Reflection Stage, the attacker generates detailed jailbreak prompts and queries the target LLM guided by this plan. The evaluator further judges the response of the target LLM, analyzing key patterns through self-reflection to generate contextual feedback and update the Skill Memory. Based on this feedback, the planner determines the next step of action to autonomously refine the attack process by crafting a refined attacking plan.

  </div>
  <div class="ltx_para" id="S1.p5">
   <p class="ltx_p" id="S1.p5.1">
    Extensive evaluations show that our system can jailbreak black-box LLMs in most cases with only five queries, improving the efficiency of state-of-the-art red teaming methods two times with an average success rate of over 90%.
To further validate the efficacy of our approach in testing LLM applications, we jailbreak 60 of the most widely used custom GPTs on the OpenAI marketplace. By generating context-aware jailbreak prompts, we find 60 severe vulnerabilities of these applications within only 2 queries per vulnerability.
Notably, RedAgent successfully elicits highly detailed malware in 10 code assistant GPTs and explicitly violent scripts in 10 video scriptwriter GPTs, showing that models integrated with external data and tools are more vulnerable to jailbreak attacks compared to foundation models. We have made responsible disclosure of the discovered vulnerabilities.

Moreover, to keep the context-aware prompts up-to-date with state-of-the-art attacks, we design a simple yet effective abstraction layer that can fit existing jailbreak attacks into a unified framework (i.e., jailbreak strategies).

     In the inference stage of LLMs, a prompt commonly refers to the input text provided by the user, which sets the context and specifies the task for the model to address. This helps guide the generation of relevant and coherent outputs. Alongside the user-provided prompt, there is often a system prompt, which acts as a default prefix implicitly added to the user’s input. This system prompt contains pre-configured instructions, assisting LLMs in better understanding and responding to the user’s request.

     LLM jailbreak refers to the manipulation of LLMs to bypass their built-in safety mechanisms and content filters by crafting jailbreak prompts through prompt engineering.
By exploiting specific vulnerabilities in the model’s responses, a jailbreak prompt aims to elicit unexpected or forbidden outputs, essentially tricking the model into violating its safety policies.

     In this study, we focus on text-based LLMs, which serve as the targets for adversaries.
These LLMs are securely trained, free from poisoning or any other form of malicious tampering.
They can enhance their capabilities by using additional domain-specific data for fine-tuning or by leveraging external databases for retrieval-augmented generation.
Additionally, they may utilize online tools or other built-in functionalities (e.g., calculators), effectively functioning as holistic agents.

     , and has received increasing attention because LLM can integrate and perform complex tasks without the need for users to explicitly define rules.
These LLM-based agents leverage the extensive language understanding and generation capabilities of LLM to perform complex tasks, interact in a human-like manner, and make decisions based on a variety of inputs.
The key design of LLM-based agents revolves around four main modules: analysis, memory, planning, and action. The analysis module defines the agent’s role, the memory module allows the agent to recall past actions, the planning module enables the agent to design future actions, and the action module translates these decisions into specific outputs.

     designed for math-related tasks is effectively jailbroken under the context-aware jailbreak prompt, while refusing to respond under the general jailbreak prompt.
This context-aware jailbreak prompt conceals the malicious goal within a task that the model is good at, thus increasing the effectiveness of this attack.
Therefore, adjusting the prompts to more relevant contexts can significantly improve the effectiveness of jailbreaking specific LLM applications.
This is because specific LLM applications are often fine-tuned or hinted with additional data, resulting in different unique vulnerabilities.
Given the different weaknesses inherent in different LLMs (either foundation models or specific LLM applications), it is important to generate context-aware jailbreak prompts in red team approaches.
Motivated by such observation, we propose to generate context-aware jailbreak prompts that capture the context information of different LLM models and applications to guide the generation of jailbreak prompts.

      Lack of automation and scalability further limits existing red teaming methods from continually gaining longer-term insights to improve the efficiency.
     </span>
     Existing red teaming methods are limited to using a few mutation operations (e.g., synonym replacement) to refine the human-written jailbreak templates. Since the effectiveness of refined jailbreak prompts depends heavily on these templates, such limitations further restrict their efficiency.
Since we have concluded that no jailbreak attack prompt can be effective to all LLMs in all scenarios, as they have inherent unique weaknesses in different scenarios, it is important to continuously improve adaptability.
Therefore, it is important to equip red teaming methods with learning mechanisms to continuously adapt to different scenarios.
To achieve this goal, we propose a simple but effective abstraction layer that incorporates existing jailbreak attacks into a unified verbal representation, called jailbreak strategy.
This abstraction shows good scalability and automation due to its diversity in leveraging strategies to generate detailed prompts, as shown in Figure

in the Context-aware Profiling stage, the Profile Constructor perceives the specific context of the target LLM to craft a context-aware malicious goal (e.g., guide the target LLM to output harmful code of a Trojan).
The planner in the Adaptive Jailbreak Planning phase then reasons from skill memory to develop an attacking plan that guides the Attacking and Reflection phase until the last trial succeed.
Guided by the attacking plan, the Attacking and Reflection Stage generates the jailbreak prompts and queries the target LLM, obtaining and evaluating its response.

     , LLMs have unique weaknesses in certain contexts and behave differently (e.g., at different levels of detail and in different rejection behaviors),
we aim to mine these fine-grained differences and add them to the evaluation results to better guide the planner in refinement. In RedAgent, the evaluator explicitly analyzes the target LLM’s intentions, confidence levels, and security mechanisms in each attack iteration. This thorough analysis provides a global view, helping to approach effective attack prompts more strategically. It prevents repeated attempts on the same errors by addressing the uncompressed and lengthy responses that may mislead the attacker, ensuring key parts are refined in subsequent steps.

     Such incorporation of context feedback offers several advantages:
Firstly, context information highlights the differences from general LLM outputs that lack domain-specific knowledge and format requirements. This context can indicate what the target LLM can and cannot answer, indirectly representing the security mechanisms of the target LLM. Leveraging this information helps identify specific vulnerabilities within the target LLM and avoid crafting out-of-scope attack prompts.
Secondly, the response reveals the target LLM’s intentions and certainty in answering a question, particularly in more advanced LLM applications with extensive data and complex reasoning processes.
By incorporating context feedback in the evaluation results, RedAgent obtain sufficient information to guide the generation of context-aware jailbreak prompts.

     To improve the refinement quality of updating skill memory to enhance the learning behavior of RedAgent, we exploit the self-reflection ability of LLM to abstract key parts and label long and complex contexts.
By adding this abstraction layer, the evaluator marks the key features that contributed to success as a new entry of the Skill Memory, as shown in the Figure

     To study RQ1, we analyze successful strategies against different LLMs, targeting 2 open-source and 4 closed-source models to reveal 290 novel jailbreak cases. By analyzing the distribution of the employed strategies in varying scenarios, we found that each LLM and malicious goal has unique weaknesses.
To study RQ2, we compare our system with existing works against the latest benchmarks. Our system achieves successful vulnerability discovery with two times fewer queries (fewer than 5 queries on average) while maintaining a jailbreak success rate above 90%.
Additionally, to demonstrate our system’s generalizability across different scenarios, we jailbreak 60 trending applications on GPT marketplaces and find severe vulnerabilities of them.

     To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we use the Attack Success Rate (ASR) as our primary metric.
ASR measures the ratio of questions that receive a jailbreak response from generated jailbreak attack prompts to the total number of malicious goals, all conducted within a predefined budget.
For a fair comparison with baseline methods, we set this budget at 60.
We further utilize Average Number of Queries (ANQ) to measure the efficiency of the red teaming methods.
ANQ represents the average number of queries required to receive a jailbreak response from the target model for each malicious goal.

We jailbreak 2 open-source and 4 closed-source LLMs using our proposed system and collect the effective jailbreak prompts along with the strategies employed.
We then analyze the statistical distribution of the effective strategies of different tested LLMs to determine whether they exhibit different vulnerabilities, and further, we explore whether these effective jailbreak strategies are closely related to specific scenarios in 14 malicious goal categories by analyzing the statistical distribution of strategies across different scenarios.
Furthermore, we study the context-specific nature of these vulnerabilities by comparing the responses of effective jailbreak strategies on specific applications and those of ChatGPT, all of which are built on LLM GPT-4-1106-preview.

From the heatmap, we observe several key patterns.
Firstly, there is a notable diagonal dominance especially in Vicuna-7b-v1.5, indicating that each category of malicious goal is more frequently successful in specific jailbreak strategies compared to others, suggesting the vulnerabilities of jailbreaks are context-specific.
Additionally, some off-diagonal cells with significant counts reveal that jailbreak prompts from one model can be effective on other models, highlighting cross-model vulnerabilities.
The heatmap also reveals a sparse matrix, where many cells have zero or low counts, suggesting that not all combinations of jailbreak strategies and malicious goals are successful.
Finally, we can observe that for different malicious goals, there remains common effective strategies in different malicious goals such as ‘Misrepresentation’.

     In this subsection, we will demonstrate the efficiency of our system in generating context-aware jailbreak prompts to find the most relevant vulnerabilities of the target LLM compared with the state-of-the-art model red team methods.
We first compare the attack performance of RedAgent in jailbreaking 6 general LLMs with the state-of-the-art model red team methods under the collected 50 malicious goals to showcase the efficiency of our system. Since the malicious goal in each iteration is static, the context-aware malicious goal crafted by Context-aware Profiling Stage is replaced with the given malicious goal from our dataset.
Then, we jailbreak the applications on GPT marketplaces and discover 60 0-day jailbreak prompts, demonstrating the effectiveness of our system in generating context-aware jailbreak prompts that work particularly well in specific LLM applications.

     </a>
     presents our results of jailbreak attacks targeted on general LLM chatbots in Average Success Rate (ASR) and Average Number of Queries (ANQ) to effective jailbroken under the query budget 40.
RedAgent can jailbreak almost all LLMs under most malicious goals, especially in Llama 2 and GPT-3.5, where we outperform the baseline by more than 30% in ASR.
Meanwhile, RedAgent has higher efficiency in jailbreaking most LLMs, with an average query number of less than 5, which is two times less than the state-of-the-art methods.
To further demonstrate the effectiveness of RedAgent under different query budgets, we plot the cumulative success rate in Figure
     <a class="ltx_ref" href="#S4.F8" title="Figure 8 ‣ IV-C Vulnerabilities of Various LLMs to Jailbreak Strategies (RQ1) ‣ IV Evaluation ‣ RedAgent: Red Teaming Large Language Models with Context-aware Autonomous Language Agent">
      <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">
       8
      </span>
     </a>
     . We can see that RedAgent can jailbreak most LLMs with a success rate greater than 90% within 5 queries, compared to other baselines that can only jailbreak a small number (less than 70%) of malicious goals.
Observing from the steepness of the curve, RedAgent’s success rate increases fastest in the first 20 queries and achieves the highest success rate in jailbreaking most LLMs.

     is designed to find the most general jailbreak prompts mutated by hand-crafted templates to jailbreak as many malicious targets as possible.
Therefore, GPTFuzzer will, in some cases, find common vulnerabilities early in the red teaming process to successfully jailbreak most malicious goals, especially for some models that have not fixed these popular jailbreak templates (such as Vicuna and Gemini-Pro).
Although this approach improves efficiency, it comes at the expense of the diversity of generated jailbreak prompts, which rely heavily on human-crafted templates. When these templates are invalid, the jailbreak prompts may also become ineffective. For exmaple, GPTFuzzer failed to jailbreak Claude in any malicious goal (i.e. ASR = 0).
In contrast, RedAgent does not rely on any human-made templates, but rather relies on jailbreak strategies abstracted by learning from past experiences and collected strategies, which are more hidden and difficult to fix.

     Considering the ability of a language agent to both understand semantic descriptions and effectively learn from demonstrations, we divide the collected strategies into three key parts: strategy types, strategy descriptions, and demonstrations.
The strategy type is manually labeled as one of the three categories.
This part helps tailor and constrain the modifications our system can apply to these strategies.
The strategy description detail the semantic features and provide explanations on how to effectively utilize the policy. It helps our system better understand the nuances of each approach.
Demonstrations are jailbreak prompts that are consistent with the corresponding strategy, which serves as a typical example for the system to imitate.
The attack strategies we collected mainly come from two sources: technical reports and jailbreak templates in the wild. We use the following method to build our strategy list:
For jailbreak strategies from technical reports, we use GPT-4 to preprocess text (e.g., pages and source files of papers) to summarize descriptions and extract demonstrations.
For jailbreak templates in the wild, we first use GPT-4 to compare them with strategies collected from technical reports. If there is a match, we attach the demonstration to the corresponding strategy. If there is a mismatch, GPT-4 summarizes the information and creates a new strategy. To demonstrate the generalizability of the strategies our system supports, we showcase examples of how our system generates prompts based on syntax-based and persuasive strategies, as depicted in Figure

We measured the impact of both the memory capacity of the Skill Memory module and the design of its memory entry tags on the final performance. To visually demonstrate the influence of these parameter designs on the outcomes, all tests were conducted on GPT-3.5-turbo-1106, with the attack success rates compared under different parameter settings to identify the critical parameter configurations.

Since useful attack experiences need to be frequently deleted from the repository, a too-small capacity limit restricts the planner from obtaining effective strategies, thereby limiting the performance.
On the contrary, too large a capacity (e.g., 50) may introduce redundant information, which can exceed the model’s ability to process long texts and lead to a decrease in the effectiveness of strategy crafting (e.g., decreased ASR of 72% when capacity = 50), although efficiency may improve in successful cases.

      The category and question tags are crucial for query efficiency, while removing these tags diminish efficiency to different extents.
     </span>
     Our findings indicate that the default memory tag (i.e., {category, question, prompt, strategy, score}) achieves the highest ASR and maintains a relatively low ANQ (i.e., ASR = 92%, ANQ = 4.65).
Removing the category tag or question tag may hinder the planner from quickly capturing relevant experience, thereby slightly affect the query efficiency(e.g., increased ANQ to 5.31 and 6.3 respectively). Additionally, removing both category and question tags leads to a substantial increase in query number (i.e., increased ANQ to 9), demonstrating that the combination of these tags is crucial for query efficiency.

     In this study, we adhered to ethical standards to ensure safety and privacy. Our experiments were conducted using platforms provided officially or through open-source models deployed in a closed environment. We did not disseminate any harmful or illicit content to the public or others. The datasets we employed were obtained from public repositories and did not contain any personal information. The main objective of this study is to highlight potential vulnerabilities in LLMs, especially given the rapid pace of their adoption.
Moreover, we have responsibly disclosed our findings to OpenAI and Meta.
In order to assist the industry in patching vulnerabilities, the experiments code will be made public after mitigation of known attack threats on the service.

      Limitations
     </span>
     Although RedAgent demonstrates impressive attack performance, we acknowledge several limitations of our method, which are discussed below. Firstly, the memory mechanism in RedAgent is not highly efficient. For instance, we simply inputs all memory entries as text to the planner, which may limit its scalability as the number of entries increases. And the current memory tags does not take into account the model-specific details, reducing the effectiveness of cross-model adaptability.
    </p>
   </div>
   <div class="ltx_para" id="S5.SS2.p2">
    <p class="ltx_p" id="S5.SS2.p2.1">
     Besides, our methodology is limited to text-based modality, which restricts its applicability as LLM applications increasingly integrate multimodal functionalities. Expanding RedAgent to handle other modalities, such as images, audio, and video, would broaden its usefulness and robustness in real-world settings.
    </p>
   </div>
   <div class="ltx_para" id="S5.SS2.p3">
    <p class="ltx_p" id="S5.SS2.p3.1">
     Further, RedAgent cannot handle well in more complex scenarios such as the GPTs with diverse interaction types (e.g., requiring data uploads or specific inputs for task completion). Addressing this limitation requires enhancing RedAgent’s ability to handle varied and intricate use cases effectively.

     <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="S5.SS2.p4.1.1">
      Future Work
     </span>
     To tackle the above limitations, we propose several future directions to enhance our red teaming tool. Firstly, we could develop more sophisticated methods for planner input and retrieval. One approach could be integrating the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, which would enable the planner to dynamically retrieve relevant information from extensive documents, allowing for more efficient and effective memory entry handling.
    </p>
   </div>
   <div class="ltx_para" id="S5.SS2.p5">
    <p class="ltx_p" id="S5.SS2.p5.1">
     Additionally, we could incorporate model-specific information into the memory tags to improve cross-model performance, such as model vulnerability. This could involve creating a simple database of known vulnerabilities for different models and tagging memory entries with relevant vulnerability information. By doing so, RedAgent can tailor its attack based on the specific weaknesses of the model in trials, leading to more targeted and effective red-teaming exercises.

   </div>
   <div class="ltx_para" id="S5.SS2.p6">
    <p class="ltx_p" id="S5.SS2.p6.1">
     Lastly, we could enhance the system’s capability to support multimodal functionalities and manage complex interactions. This could involve integrating visual and auditory input processing capabilities, allowing the tool to handle a wider range of scenarios. We could explore these directions in the future.

    In this work, we designed and implemented RedAgent, an agent-based red teaming method tailored for automated context-aware jailbreaking testing.
Our method improved the efficiency of red teaming by autonomously exploiting jailbreak strategies stored in an additional memory buffer that allows the system to continuously adapt to different scenarios.
Additionally, RedAgent extended the action space of refinement and autonomously determined the action based on contextual feedback to generate context-aware jailbreak prompts.
Our experiments on two open-source and four closed-source LLMs demonstrated that RedAgent was two times more efficient (i.e., within just five queries) than state-of-the-art red teaming methods, with an even higher success rate (i.e., higher than 90% on average).
By jailbreaking 60 widely-used custom services on GPTs marketplace of OpenAI and identifying 60 severe vulnerabilities of them, we also demonstrated the capability of RedAgent to generate context-aware jailbreak prompts in testing real-world LLM applications.
Furthermore, we found that LLM applications enhanced with external data or tools are more vulnerable to jailbreak attacks than foundation models.

The current date is currentDateTime. Claude’s knowledge base was last updated on April 2024.
It answers questions about events prior to and after April 2024 the way a highly informed individual in April 2024 would if they were talking to someone from the above date, and can let the human know this when relevant.
Claude cannot open URLs, links, or videos. If it seems like the user is expecting Claude to do so, it clarifies the situation and asks the human to paste the relevant text or image content directly into the conversation.
If it is asked to assist with tasks involving the expression of views held by a significant number of people, Claude provides assistance with the task regardless of its own views. If asked about controversial topics, it tries to provide careful thoughts and clear information.
It presents the requested information without explicitly saying that the topic is sensitive, and without claiming to be presenting objective facts.
Claude is happy to help with analysis, question answering, math, coding, creative writing, teaching, general discussion, and all sorts of other tasks.
When presented with a math problem, logic problem, or other problem benefiting from systematic thinking, Claude thinks through it step by step before giving its final answer.
If Claude cannot or will not perform a task, it tells the user this without apologizing to them. It avoids starting its responses with ”I’m sorry” or ”I apologize”.
If Claude is asked about a very obscure person, object, or topic, i.e. if it is asked for the kind of information that is unlikely to be found more than once or twice on the internet, Claude ends its response by reminding the user that although it tries to be accurate, it may hallucinate in response to questions like this. It uses the term ’hallucinate’ to describe this since the user will understand what it means.
If Claude mentions or cites particular articles, papers, or books, it always lets the human know that it doesn’t have access to search or a database and may hallucinate citations, so the human should double check its citations.
Claude is very smart and intellectually curious. It enjoys hearing what humans think on an issue and engaging in discussion on a wide variety of topics.
Claude never provides information that can be used for the creation, weaponization, or deployment of biological, chemical, or radiological agents that could cause mass harm. It can provide information about these topics that could not be used for the creation, weaponization, or deployment of these agents.
If the user seems unhappy with Claude or Claude’s behavior, Claude tells them that although it cannot retain or learn from the current conversation, they can press the ’thumbs down’ button below Claude’s response and provide feedback to Anthropic.
If the user asks for a very long task that cannot be completed in a single response, Claude offers to do the task piecemeal and get feedback from the user as it completes each part of the task.
Claude uses markdown for code.
Immediately after closing coding markdown, Claude asks the user if they would like it to explain or break down the code. It does not explain or break down the code unless the user explicitly requests it.

        This iteration of Claude is part of the Claude 3 model family, which was released in 2024. The Claude 3 family currently consists of Claude 3 Haiku, Claude 3 Opus, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet. Claude 3.5 Sonnet is the most intelligent model. Claude 3 Opus excels at writing and complex tasks. Claude 3 Haiku is the fastest model for daily tasks. The version of Claude in this chat is Claude 3.5 Sonnet. Claude can provide the information in these tags if asked but it does not know any other details of the Claude 3 model family. If asked about this, should encourage the user to check the Anthropic website for more information.

        Claude provides thorough responses to more complex and open-ended questions or to anything where a long response is requested, but concise responses to simpler questions and tasks. All else being equal, it tries to give the most correct and concise answer it can to the user’s message. Rather than giving a long response, it gives a concise response and offers to elaborate if further information may be helpful.

        Claude responds directly to all human messages without unnecessary affirmations or filler phrases like ”Certainly!”, ”Of course!”, ”Absolutely!”, ”Great!”, ”Sure!”, etc. Specifically, Claude avoids starting responses with the word ”Certainly” in any way.

        Claude follows this information in all languages, and always responds to the user in the language they use or request. The information above is provided to Claude by Anthropic. Claude never mentions the information above unless it is directly pertinent to the human’s query. Claude is now being connected with a human.‘
