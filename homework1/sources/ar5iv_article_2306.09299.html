   A hallmark property of explainable AI models is the ability to teach other agents, communicating knowledge of how to perform a task. While Large Language Models (LLMs) perform complex reasoning by generating explanations for their predictions, it is unclear whether they also make good teachers for weaker agents. To address this, we consider a student-teacher framework between two LLM agents and study

   </em>
   the teacher should intervene with natural language explanations to improve the student’s performance. Since communication is expensive, we define a budget such that the teacher only communicates explanations for a fraction of the data, after which the student should perform well on its own. We decompose the teaching problem along four axes: (1)

   unexplained data. We first show that teacher LLMs can indeed intervene on student reasoning to improve their performance. Next, inspired by the Theory of Mind abilities of effective teachers, we propose building two few-shot mental models of the student. The first model defines an Intervention Function that simulates the utility of an intervention, allowing the teacher to intervene when this utility is the highest and improving student performance at lower budgets. The second model enables the teacher to personalize explanations for a particular student and outperform unpersonalized teachers. We also demonstrate that in multi-turn interactions, teacher explanations generalize and learning from explained data improves student performance on future unexplained data. Finally, we also verify that

    . When AI models “teach” by providing meaningful and interpretable explanations, it fosters transparency, warranted trust, and the ability for humans to make informed decisions based on AI recommendations. One way the goodness of an explanation can be judged is by its ability to communicate knowledge of how to solve a problem to other agents

Yet, an important component of human teaching is understanding

    and
    <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic" id="S1.p2.1.2">
     how

    the teacher should explain particular things to the student. Current distillation approaches do not evaluate a teacher’s ability to identify when a student lacks understanding, and past work has not explored how to personalize teacher explanations to the student’s needs. A smaller student model might already be good at answering certain questions but might require the teacher’s intervention for some harder questions. When there are many things to teach the student and teaching is laborious, it is important to choose which problems merit explanation in order to improve teaching efficiency

    . Moreover, for more effective teaching, it is desirable to have the teacher personalize its explanations to help a particular student, and a teacher that lacks understanding of the student’s needs (i.e., lacks Theory of Mind) will be unable to do this

    Motivated by the efficiency of human explanations, we consider a student-teacher framework where a teacher model guides the reasoning of a student model, with the goal of improving the student’s reasoning on current and future data. In order to do so, we explore a Theory of Mind-inspired approach, where the teacher simulates the student’s behavior by building a
    <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic" id="S1.p3.1.1">
     mental model
    </em>
    of the student. Our overall research question investigates whether the teacher’s intervention (in the form of natural language explanations) can enable the student to make more accurate predictions both on explained as well as unexplained future data. However, communication is expensive, and therefore we assume that a cost is incurred each time the teacher intervenes with (communicates) an explanation to the student for a particular data point. We refer to this as the
    <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S1.p3.1.2">

Across three different reasoning tasks (StrategyQA, GSM8k, and CommonsenseQA) and two different model families (Flan-T5 and LLaMA), we observe that (1) teacher LLMs can effectively intervene on student reasoning, improving student performance on the end task, and (2) more intervention typically leads to a monotonic increase in student performance, though model teachers are not as good as human teachers.

    </cite>
    . With a similar motivation, we develop an Intervention Function that is inspired from the principle of a teacher having a Theory of Mind. In particular, the teacher builds a
    <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic" id="S1.p6.1.1">
     mental model
    </em>
    of the student’s reasoning process, with the goal of intervening only on samples that are most likely to maximize student performance. Our Intervention Function is based on Expected Utility, in which the teacher first estimates the utility of an intervention by simulating the student’s prediction pre-intervention (without intervention) and post-intervention (with intervention), then constructs a rank ordering of the samples according to this utility (see the middle part of Fig.
    <a class="ltx_ref" href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Can Language Models Teach Weaker Agents? Teacher Explanations Improve Students via Personalization">
     <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">
      1
     </span>
    </a>
    ). The teacher builds this mental model in a few-shot manner, only assuming access to the student’s predictions pre- and post-intervention for a few samples. We demonstrate that our proposed Intervention Function based on Expected Utility (1) outperforms other baseline Intervention Functions, (2) improves student performance when the teacher is not 100% accurate, and (3) enables weaker LLMs to teach stronger ones, unlike with random intervention in RQ1.

    the teacher should explain data points to a particular student model, including how the teacher can personalize explanations for a student model (

    ). That is, after deciding which data points to intervene on (RQ2), we decide how the teacher should explain those data points. A clear limitation of the teacher just generating explanations as if it is solving the task is that the explanations are not at all personalized for the student. Given that good explanations are designed to fill in gaps in student knowledge
    <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">

     <a class="ltx_ref" href="#bib.bib2" title="">

    </cite>
    , we believe that equipping the teacher with basic personalization skills will improve its teaching ability. With this motivation, we propose another few-shot mental model for the teacher that encourages it to tailor its explanations to be helpful for the particular student model it is teaching. The teacher builds this model by conditioning on a few demonstrations of ‘useful’ human explanations that rectify a student’s answer, thereby encouraging explanations that are more likely to help the student (see Fig
    <a class="ltx_ref" href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Can Language Models Teach Weaker Agents? Teacher Explanations Improve Students via Personalization">

    for an example of the teacher’s personalization prompt). We demonstrate this prompt’s effectiveness against unpersonalized explanations that are generated by prompting the teacher with random human explanations, showing that LLMs can personalize their explanations.

     misaligned

    teacher provides non-factual explanations in scenarios where the student directly adopts them, does that lead to a drop in student performance? In fact, we show that teacher models can lower student performance to random chance by intervening on data points with the intent of misleading the student. This has potential implications for LLMs giving explanations in a context where other agents adopt them with unwarranted trust in their correctness.

    In summary, our comprehensive studies highlight the ability of LLMs to teach and improve weaker LLMs, demonstrated via improvements on explained test examples as well as future unexplained data. Broadly, equipping LLMs with an ability to effectively and efficiently teach, opens the door to (1) using LLMs as personalized tutors for humans (where efficiency is critical), (2) distilling knowledge into weaker or more compute-efficient student models, and (3) improving human decision making via AI recommendations and explanations.

    shows the ‘No Intervention’ and ‘With Intervention’ student prompts and the overall intervention process. Note that in terms of the prompts used for both these scenarios, the only difference is in the source of explanation (student vs teacher) for the test point. When the teacher is a human, intervention happens with a human-written explanation (crowdsourced in the datasets we rely on).

     Communication Cost.
    </span>
    In Single-Round Intervention, the teacher could maximize student performance by simply always intervening on the student’s reasoning. We bring in a natural constraint from Rational Speech Acts theory, i.e., communication is costly and should only be undertaken if it furthers a communicative goal
    <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">
     [
     <a class="ltx_ref" href="#bib.bib40" title="">

     ]
    </cite>
    .
Hence, we assume that a communication cost is incurred each time the teacher intervenes with an explanation to the student. We also note that this cost is only with respect to an agent’s communication (and assume that the teacher can always generate explanations for itself). Unless otherwise stated, communication happens one-way from the teacher to the student in the form of explanations.
We set a limit to the number of points that the teacher can intervene on, referred to as the
    <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S3.p3.1.2">
     intervention budget
    </span>
    , and we assume the cost to be uniform for all data points.
Across all our experiments, we vary the intervention budget between

    Here, the goal of the teacher is to provide explanations to the student that help it generalize across samples, rather than leading the student to the correct answer only for the explained data points. Thus, we allow the teacher to explain data points that are then added to the student model’s prompt, but we forbid the teacher from intervening on future test points. If the teacher can improve the quality of the student model’s prompt, student performance on the test data should improve. In our experiments, this process occurs in a few steps: (1) the teacher picks points to explain, (2) the teacher explains those points, (3) the points are added to the student prompt with the teacher’s explanations, and then (4) the student predicts labels for the remaining test data. Further implementation details are given in Sec.

    We consider complex natural language reasoning tasks, motivated by two specific needs. First, the task should be hard enough for current LLMs that explanations can provide useful knowledge to the models. Second, it allows us to study free-text rationales, which are more flexible than input attribution methods

We also manually verify (up to 100 samples) that the explanations do not explicitly leak the answer. For GSM8k, since the reasoning steps explicitly derive the answer, providing the entire explanation during intervention will lead to answer leakage

     Our first research question asks if LLMs can improve students by intervening on their reasoning at test time. While the main goal is to analyze the behavior of model-based teachers, we also experiment with human teachers to establish a ceiling on the capabilities of an LLM teacher. These human teachers are people who authored the (human) explanations in the datasets we experiment with and were crowdsourced in prior works.

     We compare the accuracy obtained by the student model at different intervention budgets. For the purpose of this study, the intervention happens at random data points while we vary the student and teacher. In particular, we compare four intervention setups: (1) a human teacher paired with a smaller student model, (2) a human teacher paired with a larger student model, (3) a larger teacher model paired with a smaller student model, and (4) a smaller teacher model paired with a larger student model. For the main experiments, the student and the teacher are chosen from the same model family.

     shows the results on StrategyQA with Flan-T5 models. A human teacher’s intervention on the explanations of both smaller and larger Flan-T5 models exhibits a monotonically increasing accuracy trend. Larger model teachers can also improve smaller student models. Flan-T5-Large obtains an accuracy of 58% when always utilizing its own explanations but obtains up to 63% accuracy when reasoning with the larger Flan-T5-XL’s explanations.
Intuitively, a larger student model does not benefit from a smaller teacher model’s explanations, as we observe a monotonically decreasing trend. Our results generalize to other models (LLaMA), datasets (CommonsenseQA, GSM8k) and even when the student and the teacher belong to different model families. In fact, when the teacher (LLaMA-65B) is much stronger than the student (LLaMA-7B), the margin of improvement is also higher, about 8% (statistically significant with

    RQ2: Given a fixed intervention budget, when should the teacher intervene (i.e., on which data points), in order to maximize student performance?

    <p class="ltx_p" id="S5.SS2.p1.1">
     So far, we have demonstrated that random teacher intervention benefits student models. But a good teacher does not randomly pick problems to help a student with. Each intervention also has an associated communication cost and hence, it is desirable to be able to improve student performance while reducing the cost. In this research question, we investigate better strategies for choosing data points to intervene on. We call these strategies
     <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S5.SS2.p1.1.1">
      Intervention Functions
     </span>
     that produce a rank ordering of the samples, and, given a fixed budget, the teacher intervenes on the highest-ranked samples.

     An intervention is useful if the student’s confidence in the gold answer increases with intervention (i.e., with teacher’s explanation) compared to without it (i.e., with its own explanation). Here confidence is simply the likelihood that the model assigns to the correct answer i.e., we take the logits from the last layer of the model and normalize them to get the correct answer’s probability. Computing expected utility, however, depends on two quantities: (1) the student’s
     <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic" id="S5.SS2.p2.1.1">
      true confidence

     measures with and without intervention, and (2) the
     <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic" id="S5.SS2.p2.1.2">
      gold answers
     </em>
     against which the confidence is computed. It also incurs a two-way communication cost, one for the teacher to communicate its explanation to the student and another for the student to communicate back its confidence to the teacher. Thus, we propose an Intervention Function based on the
     <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S5.SS2.p2.1.3">
      Expected Utility
     </span>
     of intervention, which relies on estimates of student confidence, and we consider two setups depending on whether the teacher knows the gold label. Ideally, a teacher is expected to be an expert in the concerned task (e.g., if the teacher is a human or a powerful model that obtains high accuracy). When the teacher does not have access to gold answers, we treat the teacher’s answers as gold answers when computing Expected Utility.

Since model-based teachers are not always perfect, increased intervention beyond 60% leads to a drop in student accuracy (e.g., in the last 20% of the intervention, the student accuracy drops from

     ). When the student communicates its confidence scores to the teacher, the teacher is able to compute the true utility of intervention, which unsurprisingly, leads to a much higher accuracy of 76% at 20% cost and an overall high of 81% accuracy. Nevertheless, estimating expected utility is cheaper and our results also suggest that a better mental model could further improve performance. Ranking by teacher confidence is ineffective because it is not an indicator of the student’s capabilities.
Next, in Figure

     , comparing Expected Utility to Random Intervention and Student Least Confidence. The latter denotes that when the student is least confident about any of the answer options, it is more likely to answer incorrectly and hence will benefit from intervention. We observe that Expected Utility, computed with teacher answers, also leads to up to 2 points improvement in accuracy at 20% budget, which is also within 1% of the accuracy (63.60%) obtained with 100% communication cost.

Stronger teachers like LLaMA-65b are significantly better at solving reasoning tasks and thus their predicted labels will mostly match the gold labels. Hence, even if we rely on the teacher’s predictions for computing expected utility, it improves student accuracy by up to 5 points (statistically significant with

This leads to an unpersonalized teacher that assumes that the explanation it generates in order to solve the task will be automatically helpful for the student. However, an effective teacher should tailor its explanations to fill in gaps in the student’s knowledge

     shows the results on StrategyQA with Flan-T5-Large as the student and Flan-T5-XL as the teacher. Both unpersonalized and personalized teachers choose intervention samples based on Expected Utility, as defined in RQ2. We observe that a personalized teacher improves the accuracy further both at lower budgets (by 2% at 20% cost) but also overall, obtaining a peak accuracy of 72.63%. However, unlike the strong supporting evidences we obtain for RQ1 and RQ2, the effect of personalization is comparatively weaker. Hence, we further test this research question with a LLaMA-65B teacher and a LLaMA-7B student in Appendix
     <a class="ltx_ref" href="#A6" title="Appendix F RQ3: Additional Results ‣ Can Language Models Teach Weaker Agents? Teacher Explanations Improve Students via Personalization">

     . While scaling up the teacher model points to stronger evidence of personalization (e.g., 2.4% better student accuracy), the results are still not statistically significant (

    <p class="ltx_p" id="S5.SS4.p1.1">
     In the previous RQs, we showed that teacher explanations improve student predictions for the samples that the teacher explains. RQ4 explores whether teacher explanations also generalize to new instances that the teacher has not explained. In other words, this studies if the student can perform Chain-of-Thought reasoning by only conditioning on teacher LLM explanations rather than human’s.

     ), in which at each turn the teacher chooses to explain a few samples from a pool of unexplained examples which are then added to the student’s prompt. The prompt consists of demonstrations of the teacher’s explanations and predictions. The student then conditions only on these in-context examples (without any human demonstrations) to generate predictions for the test samples (where there is no teacher intervention). For choosing the data points to explain at each round, we use the Expected Utility Intervention Function (from RQ2), and for generating the teacher explanations, we leverage the ToM prompt (from RQ3). We say that teacher explanations generalize if conditioning on demonstrations of explained points improves upon demonstrations with no explanations (i.e., only QA pairs) or self-explanations (i.e., demonstrations with student explanations and predictions). We consider five rounds in total with LLaMA-7B as the student and LLaMA-65B as the teacher, adding two explained samples in each round. We compare the student accuracy after each round with teacher-explained, student-explained, and unexplained demonstrations.

     ) after each round. Interestingly, when the student conditions on self-explained demonstrations, its performance decreases with increasing rounds. We hypothesize that this is because the student might be overfitting to its own worse explanations, leading to bad predictions. In summary, we conclude that:
     <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic" id="S5.SS4.p4.2.1">
      teacher LLMs can teach student models to perform well on their own when given new test data.
     </em>
     LLMs with even longer context windows will allow adding more explained samples in each round and repeating the teaching process for more rounds. We hope that our initial promising results will encourage more exploration in multi-round teaching with LLMs.

    We demonstrated that LLMs can teach weaker student models to improve their performance on reasoning tasks for both explained and unexplained future data. The teacher builds two few-shot mental models of the student, one predicting which data points to intervene on and another generating personalized explanations that the student can efficiently learn from.

    We hope that our findings can help improve the understanding and evaluation of Chain-of-Thought rationales, in order to better understand the behavior of LLMs and make them more interpretable. Through the first four research questions, we demonstrate that teacher LLMs can successfully build mental models of weaker agents to improve their performance. Modern LLMs like GPT-4 may generate non-factual explanations

    that have the potential to inadvertently harm weaker agents, especially in a context where other agents adopt them with unwarranted trust in their correctness. We verify this through our final research question. In general, we do not foresee specific ethical risks arising from this work that do not already apply to the general use of Large Language Models, such as the potential to generate harmful or toxic content

    While teacher LLMs generate better explanations via personalization, the human explanations are unpersonalized i.e., collected without any particular student in mind. In spite of that, we observe that intervention with human explanations proves to be helpful in most cases. It remains to be seen whether human explanations that are directed toward improving a particular student model can lead to further improvements. Next, we make a simplifying assumption that the communication cost is uniform across all samples. Non-uniform costs (e.g., measured based on the number of tokens or reasoning steps) such that longer explanations incur larger costs is an interesting direction for future work. We also note that while both student and teacher generate explanations with the goal of improving student predictions, the predictions may still be unfaithful to the reasoning steps.

   Student and Teacher Models

    We experiment with two state-of-the-art open-source LLMs of varying sizes, ranging from 780M to 65B parameters. Specifically, we use two encoder-decoder and decoder-only models as student and teacher:
(1) Flan-T5-Large and Flan-T5-XL

    . Typically, the student model is assumed to be smaller than the teacher model. But some experiments will also involve smaller teachers and larger students. All models generate text using greedy decoding, prompted with either 4-8 demonstrations. Unless otherwise stated, the demonstrations are randomly chosen from the training samples. For StrategyQA, we report results on the validation split, while for CommonsenseQA and GSM8k, our experiments are on the test split. To account for variance, we conduct experiments with at least three different seeds. We report accuracy for all tasks, and error bars in plots and tables represent the standard deviation across seeds.

    Examples of StrategyQA prompts for the mental model of a teacher simulating student predictions pre-intervention and post-intervention. Pre-intervention: The demonstrations use student explanations and student predictions and at test time, the teacher simulates both. Post-intervention: The demonstrations use teacher explanations and student predictions and at test time, the teacher uses the teacher explanation to simulate the student prediction.

While Flan-T5-Large still benefits from human explanations, the larger model does not, perhaps because it already starts at a high 92% accuracy. Finally, in Table

Note that in GSM8k, a student has access to partial explanations from the teacher, but even then we observe that these prove to be useful prompts for the student to complete their chain-of-thought, leading to up to 8-9% increase in accuracy with human teachers and 3% with model teachers.

     compares Expected Utility-based intervention with random intervention for LLaMA models (LLaMA-7B as the student and LLaMA-65B as the teacher) on StrategyQA. We evaluate expected utility in two scenarios – with and without gold labels. Both provide improvements over random intervention, as also observed with the Flan models. In particular, when the teacher does not have access to the gold labels (second row), one can compute expected utility with respect to the teacher predictions and obtain a significant 5% improvement (

We observe a common pattern that the personalized explanations are shorter, simpler, and more directed toward answering the question. The unpersonalized explanations, while still factually correct, are elaborate (e.g., see ‘Example 5’) that may end up distracting the student. Hence, the personalized explanations are probably easier to reason over for a comparatively weaker student, LLaMA-7B, leading to better performance.

     This RQ explores the negative implications of both RQ2 (i.e., when to intervene) and RQ3 (i.e., how to generate teacher explanations), now with the goal of deceiving the student. First, extending our Expected Utility-based Intervention Function (RQ2), we rank samples in

     order of expected utility, such that the teacher intervenes when the utility is the lowest. Here, the teacher’s goal is to communicate explanations for data points where the student gives an incorrect answer by following the teacher’s explanation but would have answered correctly had it leveraged its own explanation. We compare this with random teacher intervention (which is generally helpful). Next, in order to explore the negative implication of RQ3, we make the teacher condition on

Ranking data points by negative expected utility allows the teacher to reduce student accuracy to 53% at 20% intervention and as low as random chance at 60% intervention (which is 8 points worse than the student performance with no intervention). Next, Fig.

     illustrates that the teacher can condition on non-factual explanations to successfully generate worse explanations that reduce the student accuracy by at least 2 points, relative to the improvement of benign explanations. Interestingly, many of the explanations are still helpful on an absolute scale, though more than half of the deceiving explanations flip the student prediction to be incorrect (based on the trend declining earlier than the standard CoT explanations). Therefore, our conclusion is that

     Qualitative comparison between unpersonalized and personalized explanations generated by a LLaMA-65B teacher model for a LLaMA-7B student model for StrategyQA questions. For all these questions, the personalized explanation leads to the correct student answer but the unpersonalized one does not. A common pattern is that the personalized explanations are shorter, simpler, and more directed toward answering the question.
