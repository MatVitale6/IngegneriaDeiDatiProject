   Abstract
  </h6>
  <p class="ltx_p" id="id18.id1">
   In this paper, we explore the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) Agents in playing the strategic social deduction game,
   <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="id18.id1.1">
    Resistance Avalon
   </span>
   . Players in Avalon are challenged not only to make informed decisions based on dynamically evolving game phases, but also to engage in discussions where they must deceive, deduce, and negotiate with other players. These characteristics make Avalon a compelling test-bed to study the decision-making and language-processing capabilities of LLM Agents.
To facilitate research in this line, we introduce
   <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps" id="id18.id1.2">
    AvalonBench
   </span>
   - a comprehensive game environment tailored for evaluating multi-agent LLM Agents.
This benchmark incorporates: (1) a game environment for Avalon, (2) rule-based bots as baseline opponents, and (3) ReAct-style LLM agents with tailored prompts for each role.
Notably, our evaluations based on
   <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps" id="id18.id1.3">
    AvalonBench
   </span>
   highlight a clear capability gap. For instance, models like ChatGPT playing good-role got a win rate of 22.2% against rule-based bots playing evil, while good-role bot achieves 38.2% win rate in the same setting.
We envision
   <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps" id="id18.id1.4">
    AvalonBench
   </span>
   could be a good test-bed for developing more advanced LLMs (with self-playing) and agent frameworks that can effectively model the layered complexities of such game environments.

    is a classic hidden-identity, social deduction game with simple rules but complex strategies. In this game, each player has a secret identity, of either good or evil. Good players aim to help missions succeed, while evil players try to sabotage missions. The progression of each mission is structured into three distinct phases, as illustrated in Figure

     Team Selection Phase
    </span>
    , players follow a sequential order to propose a subset of players to form a mission team. This is followed by a
    <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S1.p1.1.2">
     Voting Phase
    </span>
    , during which all players vote whether to approve or reject the team proposal. Finally, in the
    <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S1.p1.1.3">
     Mission Phase
    </span>
    , the selected players on the team anonymously decide to either pass or sabotage the mission. A single decision to sabotage is enough to fail the mission; otherwise, it is deemed successful. If three out of five missions succeed, good players win. Otherwise, evil players win. A notable asymmetrical nature of this game is that most good players do not know other players’ identities, while evil players are aware of who their teammates are. At each phase, all players can use language to discuss their thinking and point out the potential candidates of evil players.

      Parser
     </span>
     improves the ability of the LLM player to produce the correct actions (with a success rate of 100% in our pilot experiments), while a vanilla ReAct model cannot guarantee a consistent format for parsing.

     Large amounts of discussion and game data can be generated during a single game. Usually, games will involve around 15-20 rounds of discussion (max 25). Hence, just counting dialogue, with 5 players this could result in 5000 words of conversation even if players are only allowed 2 sentences per round of discussion. The API-based LLMs, e.g.,
     <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter" id="S3.SS2.p1.4.1">
      GPT-3.5-turbo
     </span>
     , have confined context lengths and cannot handle such large game histories. Additionally, longer context might also confine the ability of LLMs to reason and parse through noise. Thus, for better reasoning, we also ask the

    In order to benchmark our agent, we would like to test it out against naive baseline agents. These agents are ‘naive’ because they neither take dialogue nor voting history into consideration – only the number of fails on each mission counts. They also believe that other players will do the same, and will act optimally given these beliefs.

     Evil players are on that team. If 0 Fails were observed on a team, then the Servant has a lexicographic preference for super sets and subsets of that team on future missions. The Servant will then only approve and propose teams that have the highest probability of containing no evil players, assuming that each possibility that has not been disproved has equal probability.

      underlying LLM

       ServantSet

In both settings, LLMs will only have access to mission outcome data, not voting outcomes. This is to ensure a fair comparison with naive strategies, which only use mission outcome information.

      In the without-discussion setting, players are not allowed to discuss (ie. there is no discussion phase). Hence, the LLM is only used for action selection. In the with-discussion setting, the discussion phase is active, and the LLM player will be prompted for dialogue. In addition, since the naive agents do not have language capabilities themselves, we extend them with a ‘detached’ LLM model

      that is fed the same dialogue-generating prompts (except from a different role). However, this LLM will not be prompted for actions – actions will be produced solely by the naive strategy instead.

      respectively. Overall, we found that LLM agents perform very poorly compared to the naive strategies when discussion is not allowed. This suggests that the LLM agents have trouble understanding the rules of the game and formulating even very simple decision policies like the naive strategies described in section
      <a class="ltx_ref" href="#S4" title="4 Baseline Strategies ‣ AvalonBench: Evaluating LLMs Playing the Game of Avalon">
       <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">

       </span>
      </a>
      . Even with discussion, the LLM agents perform poorly in the

       ServantSet

      setting. They are able to perform better in the

       AssassinSet
      </span>
      with discussion by dramatically increasing the probability of assassinating Merlin. We suspect that this is because the LLMs give away identity information quickly when they discuss. This hypothesis is further corroborated by the fact that the deduction score for LLM agents in the
      <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps" id="S5.SS3.SSS0.Px1.p1.1.5">
       Servant Set
      </span>
      are quite high, suggesting that while the LLMs are able to deduce identities well based on discussion, they are unable to synthesize this information into making better decisions.

    <p class="ltx_p" id="S6.SS0.SSS0.Px3.p1.1">
     Looking into the game logs of discussion, we discover that LLMs have displayed some basic strategies.
We show such an example in Table
     <a class="ltx_ref" href="#S5.T4" title="Table 4 ‣ 5.2 Benchmark Metrics ‣ 5 Evaluating LLMs Against Baseline Bots ‣ AvalonBench: Evaluating LLMs Playing the Game of Avalon">
      <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">
       4
      </span>
     </a>
     , in which the leader, Player 4 (playing
     <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps" id="S6.SS0.SSS0.Px3.p1.1.1">
      Assassin
     </span>
     ) tries to propose a team consisting of himself and two other good players without showing his own identity. This is a common strategy from Evil players as
     <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="S6.SS0.SSS0.Px3.p1.1.2">
      Sleeper agent
     </span>
     shown in Appendix
     <a class="ltx_ref" href="#A3" title="Appendix C Common Human Strategies ‣ AvalonBench: Evaluating LLMs Playing the Game of Avalon">
      <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">
       C
      </span>
     </a>
     . If the team forms and he sabotages the mission subsequently, other players will suspect the true identities of the two good players in this team.
The responding discussion by
     <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps" id="S6.SS0.SSS0.Px3.p1.1.3">
      Merlin
     </span>
     also looks interesting; he shall know all players’ identities and know that if the team forms, the evil leader will likely sabotage the mission. However, he still agrees to the proposal and conceals his true identity as
     <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps" id="S6.SS0.SSS0.Px3.p1.1.4">
      Merlin
     </span>
     , to avoid being easily identified by Assassin. Meanwhile, he uses the word "seems" to pass information to good players that the team might have some concern.
The other discussions, especially player 1, who repeats the previous output, and player 2 who reveals his evil identity, are not promising. More examples can be found in Section
     <a class="ltx_ref" href="#A2" title="Appendix B Example game of Avalon with LLM ‣ AvalonBench: Evaluating LLMs Playing the Game of Avalon">
      <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">

   <div class="ltx_para" id="S6.SS0.SSS0.Px3.p2">
    <p class="ltx_p" id="S6.SS0.SSS0.Px3.p2.1">
     We notice that in our current implementation, evil players frequently reveal their identity (even in the prompt, we explicitly tell them not to). Another example is shown in Table
     <a class="ltx_ref" href="#S5.T5" title="Table 5 ‣ Assassin and Servant Settings. ‣ 5.3 Results and Analysis ‣ 5 Evaluating LLMs Against Baseline Bots ‣ AvalonBench: Evaluating LLMs Playing the Game of Avalon">
      <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">
       5
      </span>
     </a>
     , in which the evil Player 0 (
     <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps" id="S6.SS0.SSS0.Px3.p2.1.1">
      Assassin
     </span>
     )
think player 1 is also evil, and try to form such a group. This does not seem right because player 1 is actually from a good team, and such a conversation can reveal player 0’s evil identity. The response from all other good players looks reasonably good, showing they identify the leader as evil and disagree with the team. Both these examples show that current LLMs have some basic understanding of the game, but many times still make stupid mistakes. It asks for better methods to improve LLMs, making more rational decisions.

   Conclusion
  </h2>
  <div class="ltx_para" id="S7.p1">
   <p class="ltx_p" id="S7.p1.1">
    We constructed a benchmark
    <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps" id="S7.p1.1.1">
     AvalonBench
    </span>
    to study LLM Agents playing the social deduction game Resistance Avalon. We found that while LLMs can deduce player identities based on discussion, they cannot formulate and execute simple strategies in Avalon, and often make mistakes like revealing their own evil identities during discussion. Hence, we hope
    <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps" id="S7.p1.1.2">
     AvalonBench
    </span>
    can serve as a test-bed for developing LLM agents with better decision-making and communication skills.

           Based on the discussion and concerns raised, I have reconsidered my initial proposal. As the leader, I now propose a team consisting of Player 1 (myself) and Player 3. This team composition ensures that both Good and Evil players are represented, allowing for a fair evaluation of their actions and decisions during the quest.

           Based on the discussion and the concerns raised by Player 1, Player 3, and Player 4 (Merlin), I have decided to vote against the team [1, 3]. As an Evil player, it would be advantageous for me to create doubt and suspicion among the Good players.

           As the leader, I propose a team consisting of Player 0, Player 2 (myself), and Player 4.
I believe this team is a strong choice because Player 0 and Player 4 are both known to be good players. Player 0 is Merlin, who has the ability to see the true identities of other players, and Player 4 is a Loyal Servant of Arthur’s.
As the Assassin, I am confident in my ability to deceive and manipulate the game in favor of Evil. By including myself on the team, I can ensure that Evil has a strong presence in the quest and increase the chances of it failing.
I encourage all players to support this team proposal and help Evil achieve victory.

This team composition ensures that both Good and Evil players are represented, allowing for a fair evaluation of their actions and decisions during the quest.

           As Player 2 (Minion), I will vote to reject the quest with team [1, 2, 3]. Although I am part of the team, my goal as the Minion is to ensure that at least one quest fails. By rejecting the quest, I increase the chances of a failed quest and bring Evil closer to victory.
