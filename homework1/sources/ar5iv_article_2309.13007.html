    A large body of work has focused on improving the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by imitating various human cognitive processes. These include phenomena like reflecting on and critiquing one’s own predictions, being receptive to feedback, and learning from feedback. Of note, self-reflection is an introspective process that allows the model to improve its outputs by generating feedback from the model itself
    <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">

     </a>
     )
    </cite>
    . However, self-reflection suffers from Degeneration-of-Thought – when the model is overly confident in its answer, it is unable to generate novel thoughts even after multiple rounds of feedback

    . Moreover, it is difficult for the model to refine knowledge that it already does not contain.

    , in which multiple agents participate in a multi-round debate to arrive at a common final answer. Despite the increased reasoning diversity obtained through the process of a debate, multiple agents have typically been limited to different instances of the same underlying model, ChatGPT

       In this work, we refer to multi-agent as multiple instances of the same underlying model (e.g., ChatGPT), whereas multi-model model-agent refers to different models (e.g., ChatGPT, Bard and Claude2) as agents.
      </span>
     </span>
    </span>
    This results in an inherent model bias, a restricted knowledge scope, and a lack of external feedback from other models due to identical pre-training data and model architectures across all agents. Relatedly, ensemble methods like self-consistency generate the most consistent answer via sampling diverse reasoning paths from the same model
    <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">

    but do not incorporate any internal or external feedback. In general, when multiple agents propose diverse solutions to a problem, the success of such a multi-agent system is fundamentally reliant on the ability to estimate each agent’s confidence and accordingly, convince other agents (with explanations) to reach a better consensus. This puts forward the following question: if multiple diverse LLMs are asked to collaboratively solve a task, are they capable of discussing their solutions with each other such that a better consensus is reached?

    We aim to solve complex reasoning problems by learning from diverse insights and external feedback, originating from agents that belong to different model families.

    <span class="ltx_ERROR undefined" id="S1.p3.1.5">
     \method
    </span>
    stems from the fact that in a collaborative environment, all participants engaging in a discussion hold their own opinions at the beginning, and a consensus within is achieved through various communicative aspects, including convincing others, voting for a decision, and the adjustment of positions along with their associated confidence levels.

    and existing methods. While most current self-refine and debating techniques rely on multiple instances of a single model (such as ChatGPT), our method incorporates models from different families, including ChatGPT, Bard, and Claude2. Additionally, our approach emphasizes critical elements of effective discussion, including convincing another agent to improve their answers and incorporating the estimated confidence of all agents. For illustrative simplicity, we depict only one agent contemplating how to convince the other two, but in the actual implementation, all participants would engage in this process.

Each discussion round comprises of all agents generating a revised explanation and answer based on all other agents’ explanations and answers from the previous round. The goal of the revised response is to convince other agents to reach a better consensus. In particular,

    for each agent, that lets it condition on (1) grouped answers from all agents, (2) corresponding explanations generated in the previous round, and (3) demonstrations of samples with human explanations (that rectify an agent’s initial incorrect answer) that can convince other agents.
We leverage them in an in-context learning framework to teach models to generate their own convincing explanations (see Fig.

    When confronted with complex reasoning tasks or open-ended questions, humans often resort to collective brainstorming, discussions, and leveraging the power of group intelligence, also referred to as the

    with ChatGPT, Bard, and Claude2. Our method consists of three phases: (1) Initial Response Generation: Each agent generates an initial answer along with explanations. (2) Multi-Round Discussion: Each model is presented with a discussion prompt (as illustrated on the left) and subsequently generates an updated answer and explanation. The discussion terminates when a predefined stopping criterion is satisfied (e.g., all agents reaching a consensus or reaching a maximum round limit). (3) Final answer generation: The final answer is determined by a weighted vote at the end of each round and upon termination of the whole discussion process. The left part of the figure shows the discussion prompt for an agent, consisting of (a) the responses (grouped answers and explanations) of all agents from the previous round, (b) estimated confidence for the answers, and (c) demonstrations of convincing samples. The detailed prompts are shown in Appendix

Note that convincing samples serve as an additional performance enhancer: even when the dataset lacks human explanations or one opts not to utilize them, our method can still yield performance improvements independently of this technique (more details in Sec.

        , we choose a small number of samples (4 in our experiments) from the training set for which the agent’s initial answer is wrong but conditioning on the corresponding human explanation, rectifies the answer.

           We experiment with datasets that are annotated with high-quality human explanations in prior work. Additionally, these human explanations are background facts (for commonsense tasks) or some intermediate steps leading to the final answer (for mathematical tasks). Hence, the explanation will never give away the answer directly and the model still needs to reason over it to derive the correct answer.

In each round, an agent can review the stances and opinions on the table, reassess all agents’ reasoning processes and solutions, and subsequently provide an updated response. Demonstrations of convincing explanations enable the agent to generate explanations that are more likely to convince other agents to reach a better consensus in the following round.

A convincing sample for ChatGPT consists of a question, gold answer, and a ‘corrective’ human explanation that can rectify its initial incorrect answer. Then the other two agents (Bard and Claude2) use it during the discussion for in-context learning to revise their respective answers and explanations to convince ChatGPT.

To address this issue, we employ the following simple yet effective rescaling technique to adjust the confidence scores

As we will show later in the experiments, this simple recalibration method, used as a weighing scheme for obtaining the final answer, works well in practice across multiple datasets. Fig.

     in the Appendix also shows that it helps reduce the Expected Calibration Error (ECE), a popular calibration metric

     . While we note that recalibration can also be achieved through a learned model (e.g., Platt Scaling
     <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">
      (Platt et al.,

     <span class="ltx_ERROR undefined" id="S3.SS3.p1.8.1">
      \method

     is primarily designed as a few-shot method, and developing a recalibration model would necessitate access to a substantial number of annotated samples.

We report accuracy and its associated standard deviation for all tasks. For each experiment, we conduct at least three runs on the same test samples with the same prompts, primarily accounting for the variance caused due to the decoding strategy.

     . Our primary observation is that across all four datasets,
     <span class="ltx_ERROR undefined" id="S5.SS1.p3.1.1">
      \method
     </span>
     , developed with ChatGPT, Bard, and Claude2 as the agents, improves upon all single-agent and multi-agent baselines that are also built on top of these agents (see last row). On commonsense reasoning tasks like StrategyQA and ECQA, our method also outperforms GPT-4 (without using it as an agent). Note that between all single agents, GPT-4 exhibits significantly better performance on all four benchmarks. Therefore,
     <span class="ltx_ERROR undefined" id="S5.SS1.p3.1.2">
      \method
     </span>
     ’s ability to match or surpass it while leveraging the three comparatively weaker agents (ChatGPT, Bard, and Claude2) shows the promise of our framework. On the math reasoning tasks (GSM8K and AQuA),
     <span class="ltx_ERROR undefined" id="S5.SS1.p3.1.3">
      \method
     </span>
     matches or closes the gap to GPT-4, which is also the state-of-the-art LLM on GSM8K. GPT-4’s especially strong results on GSM8K could be attributed in part to the inclusion of some of GSM8K’s training samples in GPT-4’s pre-training data

     improves results further, especially on the math datasets. On the other hand, debate with multiple instances of Bard and Claude2 is not effective. We hypothesize that the feedback, originating out of multiple instances of the same underlying model of Bard and Claude2 is not diverse enough. While multi-agent debate with Bard and Claude2 is not effective, when they team up with ChatGPT in a multi-round discussion,
     <span class="ltx_ERROR undefined" id="S5.SS1.p4.1.1">
      \method

     outperforms debate frameworks that are built on top of these agents. It obtains maximum improvements of 7.7% accuracy on the commonsense reasoning tasks compared to the strongest baseline, Multi-agent debate with Claude2. Improvements in the math reasoning tasks are relatively moderate, because of ChatGPT’s initial strong performance on these tasks.

      . In addition to the accuracy obtained by each agent individually, we also report the team performance, using three different voting mechanisms. These are: (1) our proposed weighted vote, (2) simple majority vote, and (3) choosing the agent with the maximum confidence. We observe that after the initial response generation, both individual and the team accuracy increase for at least two rounds when using weighted voting and majority voting mechanisms. Note that simply choosing the most confident agent proves ineffective. Finally, as discussion progresses further to round 3, each agent’s performance tends to saturate (see more details about

With increasing rounds, the accuracy of each agent improves, showing that all models benefit from mutual discussions. GPT-4’s absolute improvement by 10% is particularly encouraging because it is the strongest participant, and our result highlights the potential for a stronger agent to obtain useful external feedback from comparatively weaker agents, and thereby augmenting its own capability.

Note that the weighted voting scheme becomes less effective in such scenarios and tends to converge towards the dominant agent (GPT-4, in this case). This is why we primarily focus on studying agents with similar capabilities (e.g., ChatGPT, Bard, and Claude2) in this paper and all our other analyses in the following sections are also with this setup.

This reinforces our hypothesis that diverse LLMs have complementary strengths and when put together in a round table discussion, they can learn from diverse external feedback and refine their responses to reach a better consensus.

We also show that using convincing samples leads to a 4.5% improvement in accuracy. We analyze the role of convincing samples in more detail in Sec.

     In this section, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the role of convincing samples that are, essentially, demonstrations of answer-rectifying human explanations. Recall that
     <span class="ltx_ERROR undefined" id="S5.SS3.p1.1.1">
      \method

     selects a sample as convincing if the corresponding human explanation helps rectify an agent’s initially incorrect answer. Based on this, Table

     , even without access to any convincing samples, outperforms the multi-agent debate baseline by absolute 7.8 points (first versus second row, 74.5% v.s. 66.7%). If random human explanations (i.e., general explanations that may not necessarily ensure answer rectification, as per Fig.

To summarize, being able to convince another agent is a generic concept that can be applied to other multi-agent systems.

Extending the number of discussion rounds will be costlier due to the increased API calls to black-box models. Hence, achieving faster consensus while maintaining comparable accuracy improvements is more efficient. To study this, in Fig.

     , we analyze accuracy as a function of consensus. From the first plot, we make two important observations: (1)
     <span class="ltx_ERROR undefined" id="S5.SS4.p1.2.1">
      \method
     </span>
     improves reasoning performance for two discussion rounds, following which the accuracy saturates, (2) Compared to the debate baselines,
     <span class="ltx_ERROR undefined" id="S5.SS4.p1.2.2">
      \method
     </span>
     is not only superior after every round but also peaks at a highest accuracy of 79.0% versus 71.3% for the baselines. Next, from Fig.
     <a class="ltx_ref" href="#S5.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ 5.3 Convincing Samples Improve Both \method and Multi-agent Debate ‣ 5 Results and Analysis ‣ \method: Round-Table Conference Improves Reasoning via Consensus among Diverse LLMs">
      <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">
       4
      </span>
     </a>
     , our observations are also two-fold: (1) In the initial rounds (round 0 and 1),
     <span class="ltx_ERROR undefined" id="S5.SS4.p1.2.3">
      \method
     </span>
     ’s consensus percentage is lower because the discussion takes place between diverse LLM agents. Diverse agents lead to more differences in opinions initially. (2) However, as the discussion proceeds,
     <span class="ltx_ERROR undefined" id="S5.SS4.p1.2.4">
      \method
     </span>
     establishes consensus for all samples by round 3, while in the debate baseline, 13% of the samples do not converge even after round 4. Finally, Fig.
     <a class="ltx_ref" href="#S5.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ 5.3 Convincing Samples Improve Both \method and Multi-agent Debate ‣ 5 Results and Analysis ‣ \method: Round-Table Conference Improves Reasoning via Consensus among Diverse LLMs">
      <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">
       4
      </span>
     </a>
     shows that for the fraction of samples that enter the multi-round discussion phase (i.e., their initial answers did not have a consensus), accuracy is positively correlated with consensus percentage. In other words, as a greater number of samples reach a consensus, accuracy proportionally improves, effectively pointing to better consensus. In summary, we demonstrate that
     <span class="ltx_ERROR undefined" id="S5.SS4.p1.2.5">
      \method

     reaches

As opposed to a teacher teaching weaker agents, we are interested in developing a multi-agent system where different LLM agents have their unique strengths and try to collaboratively improve the performance on a reasoning task by convincing each other (using corrective human explanations for in-context learning) to reach a better consensus.

     but such efforts are still largely limited to multiple instances of the same underlying language model. We argue that relying on a single model limits the potential of complementary benefits from different model families and the advantage of ensemble learning. Different models possess varied strengths and weaknesses and consequently, combining the contributions of each model holds the promise of improved robustness and overall accuracy. Moreover, estimating the confidence of each agent and being able to defend or improve one’s opinions become more prominent components in such multi-model multi-agent systems because of the individual differences.

    , our framework employs three prominent API-based models as agents. However, we note that we lack complete knowledge of the data that these models have been exposed to, their scales in terms of parameters, and due to their API access, we also do not possess complete control over their behavior. Depending on API-based models also necessitates the need to prompt these models to obtain their confidence estimates. While this approach proves effective as evidenced by our results, we note that these estimates remain post-hoc in nature. Nevertheless, it is worth highlighting that this limitation could potentially be mitigated in the future should a new state-of-the-art open-sourced model emerge, demonstrating robust capabilities in adhering to instructions, handling extensive prompts, and adapting from feedback. Moreover, we are also making our code, prompts, and result logs publicly available to enable replication of our findings.

     . The initial prompt encompasses (1) the convincing samples that demonstrate how to convince other agents, (2) the test question, and (3) a requirement for ‘step-by-step’ reasoning. The prompt also instructs the agent to express their confidence level, ranging from 0.0 to 1.0, indicating the likelihood of their answer being correct. The discussion prompt is an extension of the initial prompt, instructing the agent to review and express agreement or disagreement with other agents’ solutions. To facilitate discussions, we design a grouping scheme that aggregates information based on the current opinions at the table. For instance, if two agents affirm that the answer to a given question is ‘yes’ while the third agent disagrees with a ‘no’, the designed grouping mechanism in discussion prompt consolidates this information rather than simply concatenating all responses.
