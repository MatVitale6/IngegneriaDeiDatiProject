   Abstract

  <p class="ltx_p" id="id1.id1">
   Predicting the future trajectories of dynamic traffic actors is a cornerstone task in autonomous driving. Though existing notable efforts have resulted in impressive performance improvements, a gap persists in scene cognitive and understanding of the complex traffic semantics. This paper proposes Traj-LLM, the first to investigate the potential of using Large Language Models (LLMs) without explicit prompt engineering to generate future motion from agents’ past/observed trajectories and scene semantics. Traj-LLM starts with sparse context joint coding to dissect the agent and scene features into a form that LLMs understand. On this basis, we innovatively explore LLMs’ powerful comprehension abilities to capture a spectrum of high-level scene knowledge and interactive information. Emulating the human-like lane focus cognitive function and enhancing Traj-LLM’s scene comprehension, we introduce lane-aware probabilistic learning powered by the pioneering Mamba module. Finally, a multi-modal Laplace decoder is designed to achieve scene-compliant multi-modal predictions. Extensive experiments manifest that Traj-LLM, fortified by LLMs’ strong prior knowledge and understanding prowess, together with lane-aware probability learning, outstrips state-of-the-art methods across evaluation metrics. Moreover, the few-shot analysis further substantiates Traj-LLM’s performance, wherein with just 50% of the dataset, it outperforms the majority of benchmarks relying on complete data utilization. This study explores equipping the trajectory prediction task with advanced capabilities inherent in LLMs, furnishing a more universal and adaptable solution for forecasting agent motion in a new way.

    Predicting the trajectories of agents primarily reasons how the future might unfold based on the observed behaviors of road users. Serving as an essential bridge connecting the perception system upward and the planning system downward, it assumes a pivotal role in the domain of autonomous driving. However, owing to the inherent stochasticity of agent motion, imbuing autonomous vehicles (AVs) with the capacity to anticipate surrounding trajectories as proficiently as humans remains a formidable challenge.

    Recent works have focused on novel deep network architectures, offering promising avenues for enhancing prediction efficacy. These endeavors, characterized by modeling temporal dependencies and spatial interactions, reframe the trajectory prediction task as a time-series forecasting problem. A significant number of them apply distinct modules to mine temporal dynamics along with spatial relationships, and further integrate trajectories into composite models that possess both spatial and temporal components, allowing for an understanding of spatio-temporal characteristics

    To accomplish this objective, we put forward Traj-LLM, a novel trajectory prediction framework, that seeks to investigate the feasibility of LLMs in inferring agents’ future trajectories devoid of explicit prompt engineering. We attempt to inject the advanced capabilities of contemporary language models into the trajectory prediction task, providing a general and easily adaptable solution for forecasting in complex driving scenarios based on LLMs. Traj-LLM starts with sparse context joint coding, responsible for parsing the features of agents and scenes into a form that LLMs understand. We then guide LLMs to learn a spectrum of high-level knowledge inherent in trajectory prediction tasks, such as scene context and social interactions. Employing the Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) technique, we cost-effectively fine-tune pre-trained LLMs to mitigate the potential disparities between trajectory tokens and natural language texts. Aiming to imitate the human-like lane focus cognitive function and further enhance the scene understanding of Traj-LLM, we present lane-aware probabilistic learning, which is driven by the pioneering Mamba module. Finally, we introduce a multi-modal Laplace decoder to achieve scene-compliant multi-modal predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Traj-LLM, empowered by the robust prior knowledge and inference capabilities of LLMs, along with the human-like lane-aware probability learning, surpasses state-of-the-art methods in evaluation metrics. Furthermore, the few-shot study further validates Traj-LLM’s prowess, where even with only half of data volume, it outperforms a majority of baselines reliant on full data utilization.

     , a language-based multi-modal pedestrian trajectory predictor, transforms the trajectory prediction issue into a question-answering task, utilizing LLMs to understand scene contexts and social relationships. These few efforts share a focus on designing pertinent prompts, shifting the paradigm towards prompt-based predictions. However, formulating clear, well-structured, and effective prompts is not a trivial task, which requires consideration of various elements, such as question-answering template

In contrast to these pioneering efforts, we propose to explore the advanced capabilities of LLMs without explicit prompt engineering, thus serving as a more general and easily adaptable solution for trajectory forecasting in complex driving scenarios.

    (e.g., object type and timestamps). Furthermore, to ensure input feature invariance regarding an agent’s location, the coordinates of all vectors are normalized to be centered around the target agent’s most recent position. For capturing sophisticated lane information, lane centerlines abstracted by polylines are divided into predefined segments. In this way, the lanes contain a variable number of vectors denoted as

    , which contains four integral components: sparse context joint encoding, high-level interaction modeling, lane-aware probability learning, and multi-modal Laplace decoder. Our approach stands as a trailblazer in exploring the ability of LLMs for trajectory prediction tasks dispensing with the need for explicit prompt engineering. The sparse context joint coding initially engages in parsing the features of agents and scenes into a form understandable by LLMs. Subsequently, the resulting representations are fed into pre-trained LLMs to address high-level interactions. To mimic the human-like lane focus cognitive function and further enhance the scene understanding of Traj-LLM, lane-aware probability learning is presented based on the well-designed Mamba module. Finally, a multi-modal Laplace decoder is used to generate reliable predictions. Below, we describe each module of Traj-LLM in detail.

     Trajectory transitions adhere to patterns governed by high-level constraints emanating from various elements in the scene. To learn these high-level interactions, we explore the capacity of LLMs to model a range of dependencies inherent in trajectory prediction tasks. Despite the semblance between trajectory data and natural language texts, direct utilization of LLMs to handle sparse context joint encodings is deemed unsuitable, given that generic pre-trained LLMs are primarily tailored for textual data processing. One alternative proposal is to undergo comprehensive retraining of the entire LLMs, a process demanding substantial computational resources, thus rendering it somewhat impracticable. Another more efficient solution lies in the application of the Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) technique to fine-tune pre-trained LLMs. By adjusting or introducing trainable parameters, PEFT showcases the outstanding capability to optimize pre-trained LLMs for downstream tasks by a large margin

     The overwhelming majority of experienced drivers merely pay attention to a few potential lane segments, which exert remarkable influence on their future motions. To mimic this human-like cognitive function and further enhance the scene understanding of Traj-LLM, we employ lane-aware probabilistic learning to continuously estimate the likelihood of motion states aligning with lane segments as shown in Algorithm 1.

    This section delineates a comprehensive series of experiments aimed at substantiating the efficacy of Traj-LLM. We commence by elucidating the experimental setup, followed by a meticulous juxtaposition of results compared with various cutting-edge approaches. To ascertain the impact of each constituent within our model, we conduct ablation experiments on Traj-LLM architectures. Furthermore, we embark on the few-short study to show the generalization capability of Traj-LLM. Lastly, we delve into a qualitative analysis of predictions.

     distance in meters between the best-predicted trajectory and its corresponding ground-truth trajectory, averaged across all points. At the same time, minFDE measures the discrepancy at the final position. MR denotes the proportion of instances where the distance between the actual endpoint and the optimal predicted endpoint exceeds 2.0 meters. In all cases, diminished values signify heightened efficacy in model performance.

     Our model is trained on 6 NVIDIA GeForce RTX4090 GPUs with the AdamW optimizer, whose batch size and initial learning rate are set to 132 and 0.001, respectively. The architecture of Traj-LLM is carefully designed, beginning with a layer of sparse context joint encoding module, followed by a high-level interaction modeling module, and ultimately incorporating three layers of lane-aware probability learning module. The hidden dimensions of all feature vectors are uniformly configured to 128.

     , outperforming the suboptimal approaches, ALAN and LAformer, by substantial margins of 7.49% and 30.30%, respectively. Furthermore, GOHOME stands out as the rasterized method in the table, yet it notably lags behind most vectorized counterparts in performance metrics. Compared with other lane-based methodologies like LaPred, Traj-LLM maintains a clear superiority, underscoring the efficacy of our lane-aware probability learning in mimicking human-like lane-focus cognitive function and enhancing scene understanding. It is worth highlighting that in contrast to models based on GCN to extract interaction dependencies, such as GATraj, Traj-LLM reduces the

     To ascertain the efficiency of Traj-LLM, we carried out a comparative analysis of the trainable parameters and inference speed, as shown in Table

     . Based on the pre-trained Large Language Model, the full Traj-LLM owns 7.72M trainable parameters, a magnitude surpassing that of its counterparts. However, Traj-LLM exhibits a pronounced advantage in inference time over LAformer and PGP, despite their comparatively diminutive parameter count. Remarkably, Traj-LLM achieves an impressive inference time of 98 ms, in a scenario featuring an average of 12 agents. The variants of Traj-LLM, including Traj-LLM (w/o Lane) and Traj-LLM (w/o LLM), with trainable parameters of 5.01M and 1.69M, respectively, boast parameter scales either on par with or smaller than those of the alternative models. Yet they also maintain a superior edge in inference speed. Fig.

Secondly, it becomes evident that fine-tuning LLMs is necessary to effectively transfer cross-modal inference capabilities to comprehension of complex traffic scenes. Last but not least, the humanoid lane-selection mechanism tremendously elevates goal-directed agent navigation accuracy, as reflected by the metric of

     In the realm of trajectory prediction, the utilization of a select few datasets to reach exceptional performance is often a coveted ideal, owing to the exorbitant costs associated with data collection and maintenance. This few-shot scenario parallels real-world situations. To effectively evaluate the advantages of leveraging pre-trained LLMs in few-shot learning settings for trajectory prediction, we elaborately orchestrated a series of experiments.

     illustrate various metrics across training data percentages ranging from 10% to 20%. Noteworthy is the revelation that Traj-LLM, even with only 50% of the data, outperforms a majority of baselines reliant on 100% data utilization across all evaluated metrics. Thanks to the innate representation learning capability encapsulated in LLMs and well-designed lane-aware probability learning, Traj-LLM consistently keeps commendable performance even in extremely sparse data scenarios (e.g., 10% to 30% training data). These compelling revelations stress Traj-LLM’s remarkable capacity for generalization and adaptation, even when confronted with insufficient samples.

      =10. From these visual insights, we can find that whether maintaining a straight path or navigating intersections to execute left or right turns, the ground truth of the target agent closely corresponds with one of the multi-modal trajectories forecast by Traj-LLM in terms of trends. Furthermore, we observe that the trajectories generated by Traj-LLM display sound rationality and compliance, as they do not exceed the boundaries of the roadway. These comprehensive predictions concerning both lateral and longitudinal vehicular behaviors robustly prove the strong predictive power of Traj-LLM.

      =10. Despite being trained on only 50% of the data, Traj-LLM consistently produces plausible predictions for the target agent across diverse scenarios, including intersections and straight driving. Furthermore, Traj-LLM accurately captures nuanced behaviors such as acceleration and deceleration. The uncertain feature of the agent’s motion is also depicted with robust multi-modal predictions. These few-shot predictions further underscore the potent predictive capability of Traj-LLM, leveraging LLMs’ exceptional scene understanding capacity and elaborately crafted lane-aware probability learning.

    In this study, we propose the Traj-LLM, a novel trajectory prediction framework, that seeks to investigate the feasibility of LLMs in inferring agents’ future trajectories without explicit prompt engineering design. Traj-LLM starts with sparse context joint coding, responsible for parsing the features of agents and scenes into a form that is understandable by LLMs. We then guide LLMs to learn a spectrum of high-level knowledge inherent in trajectory prediction tasks, such as scene context and social interactions. Aiming to imitate the human-like lane focus cognitive function and further enhance the scene understanding of Traj-LLM, we propose lane-aware probabilistic learning powered by the pioneering Mamba module. For achieving scene-compliant multi-modal predictions, this study introduces the multi-modal Laplace decoder. The experiments demonstrate that Traj-LLM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in various metrics and the few-shot study further validates Traj-LLM’s outstanding prowess.
