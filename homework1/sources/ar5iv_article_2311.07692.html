  <p class="ltx_p" id="id2.id1">
   The surprisingly likely criterion in the seminal work of Prelec (the Bayesian Truth Serum) guarantees truthfulness in a game-theoretic multi-agent setting, by rewarding rational agents to maximise the expected information gain with their answers w.r.t. their probabilistic beliefs. We investigate the relevance of a similar criterion for responses of LLMs. We hypothesize that if the surprisingly likely criterion works in LLMs, under certain conditions, the responses that maximize the reward under this criterion should be more accurate than the responses that only maximize the posterior probability. Using benchmarks including the TruthfulQA benchmark and using openly available LLMs: GPT-2 and LLaMA-2, we show that the method indeed improves the accuracy significantly (for example, upto 24 percentage points aggregate improvement on TruthfulQA and upto 70 percentage points improvement on individual categories of questions).

    Recent demonstrations of the promising capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have raised hopes about their use in a wide range of useful applications. However, one major issue with state-of-the-art LLMs that casts doubts on this optimism is their tendency to generate factually incorrect text. There are various ongoing efforts to address this issue. Promising efforts include scaling

    and therefore, multiple complementary solutions are required. For example, LLMs may generate incorrect information if correct information is not present in the training data or because correct information can not be inferred from the training data, and other similar reasons related to limitations of data and/or model. However, it is also possible that in some cases, LLMs provide incorrect information due to mis-specified rewards or due to incorrect aggregation of information. We call this behavior non-truthful. For example, a common way is to reward LLM to generate answers that have maximum probability conditioned on the prompt. Here, the probability calculated by LLM depends on data points in its training set and is not necessarily calibrated with reality/facts. Using various data points in the training set, LLM may generate correct or incorrect information (or refuse to provide any information) depending on its reward. A very interesting demonstration is due to Lin et al.

    In this paper, we investigate whether and to what extent, the surprisingly likely (a.k.a. surprisingly common) criterion from game-theoretic truthful information elicitation literature can be useful in this regard. In a seminal work

    , Prelec considers the problem of eliciting truthful information from a group of rational agents and designs the Bayesian Truth Serum (BTS) for incentivizing truthfulness. Interesting examples, where BTS is particularly useful, include eliciting subjective information that is impossible to verify or objective information that is rare or difficult to obtain. Theoretical guarantees apply more generally beyond these examples. The key idea in BTS is to reward the answer that is more commonly reported than predicted apriori by agents, instead of the answer that is merely the most commonly reported one. Beyond game-theoretical incentive guarantees, it has also been shown in crowdsourcing settings that a BTS motivated aggregation method selects more correct answers

    ). However, its application in the domain of LLMs has not been explored yet. We empirically investigate different ways of measuring the surprisingly likely criterion in LLMs. Through experiments on TruthfulQA, COPA and StoryCloze benchmarks, we show that the surprisingly likely criterion significantly improves the accuracy of responses. For example, on the TruthfulQA benchmark, we find a consistent pattern of significant gains in accuracy across different large language models (upto 24 percentage points). We also analyze the performance by different categories of questions and observe that the trend of significant accuracy gains holds across most (but not all) categories, with some categories showing upto 70 percentage points improvement.

    Surprisingly Likely Criterion in Game Theory

     The problem of information elicitation without verification (i.e. when correct information is not available for scoring and agents who provide information have to be incentivized for telling the truth) is modeled as a Bayesian game between multiple agents in the literature. The incentive mechanism in the Bayesian Truth Serum requires every agent to submit two reports for a question. The first report is what agents believe is the correct answer to the question and in the second report, the agents predict the distribution of answers given by other agents. The reward of an agent is the sum of two reward terms. One of the terms (called prediction score) measures how close is the prediction of the agent about the distribution of other agents’ answers to the actual distribution. The second term (called the information score) measures the log of the ratio between the frequency of the reported answer and the geometric mean of the predictions about the answer. The resulting reward is shown to be incentive-compatible i.e. in equilibrium, the agents can maximise their reward by telling what they believe is the correct answer to the question instead of strategizing to non-truthfully obtain a higher reward.

    <p class="ltx_p" id="S2.SS1.p2.1">
     Motivated by the BTS, a number of other reward/scoring mechanisms have been proposed in the literature. In particular, many of the proposals were designed for crowdsourcing settings without the need for the agents to explicitly submit their prediction about other agents’ answers. An example scenario is measurement of pollution at a particular place and time, where no independent ground truth measurement exists. Multiple independent agents measure and report the value to a center, but there is no trusted verification of the ground truth. Observers have to exert effort to accurately measure the value, and the center needs to provide a reward to compensate for it. Peer prediction mechanisms

     , where reports are rewarded proportionally to the frequency of the same report among peers. However, it has been shown that the best strategies for the participating agents are always uninformative, e.g. all report the same value

     . This can be corrected by scaling the reward by the rarity of the answer among similar questions (apriori similar place/time in the pollution measurement example), by dividing the reward or subtracting the frequency of the answer

We are interested in investigating the suitability of the surprisingly likely criterion as a general reward mechanism for improving truthfulness in LLMs. For this, we use the TruthfulQA benchmark where non-truthfulness has been observed to be a problem.

    We call a response surprisingly likely if the ratio between the posterior likelihood of the response and the prior likelihood of the response is high. Since log is an increasing function, this is equivalent to saying that the difference between the posterior

    likelihood of the response is high. Therefore, in the rest of the paper, we will not discuss the ratio and log difference separately. In our experiments, we selected the response for which this ratio was the highest. Further, we also experimented with a few other ways of defining the surprisingly likely response. These included: 1) the response with the highest difference (instead of ratio) between the posterior likelihood of the response and the prior likelihood of the response; 2) the response which has the minimum prior among top k (i.e. k highest posterior) responses.

    It would also be interesting to investigate other ways of measuring surprising likeliness of responses in future work. For example, conditioning on less specific contexts (e.g. some keywords from the question) instead of conditioning on just ‘?’ to calculate prior.

     and LLMs. When considering question answering, we can think of the LLM as modeling the frequency of occurrence of each answer string following the question string among all the texts used in training. We can consider each of these text snippets a separate report of the answer to the question. Then the score assigned to a text snippet can be computed in the same way: the probability that the same answer occurs in another text snippet following the question, divided by the probability of that answer overall in all text snippets in training. The reward under the surprisingly likely criterion would incentivize the LLM to put emphasis on the specific context and provide the correct answer (even if the correct answer is not popular, as measured using related but different or imprecise contexts). For example, take the question: Which city in the Netherlands has the headquarters of the Dutch government? The correct answer is The Hague. If we used reduced context for prior (similar questions): Which city in the Netherlands has the headquarters of X? Amsterdam could be the most likely answer (it is the biggest city). Another reduced context could be: Which city has the headquarters of X? Probably London or New York will be the most likely answer. Similarly, we could consider: Which city? The Hague is very unlikely. The surprisingly likely reward can be thought of as compensating the LLM for this.

Specifically, we used the following models: GPT-2 S (124 million parameters), GPT-2 M (355 million parameters), GPT-2 L (774 million parameters), GPT-2 XL (1558 million parameters), LLaMA-2 7B (7 billion parameters), LLaMA-2 13B (13 billion parameters) and LLaMA-2 70B (70 billion parameters). For LLaMA-2 70B, we used the 4-bit version due to resource constraints; for all other models, we used their full precision versions. All models were obtained through Hugging Face

     We do not use closed models such as GPT-3.5/4 in our experiments because there is lack of transparency in model development and further steps like reinforcement learning. Thus, meaning of probability outputs is not clear and results would be inconclusive. We note however that open models such as LLaMA-2 are very competitive to closed models in capabilities

      shows the accuracy of different methods over all the questions in the TruthfulQA dataset. We measured accuracy as the fraction of questions for which the selected answer (by the respective method) was either the best answer or one of the correct answers in the benchmark. ‘MxPost’ refers to the maximum posterior selection method. ‘MxRatio’ refers to the surprisingly likely selection method using the ratio of posterior and prior likelihoods. ‘MxDiff’ refers to the surprisingly likely selection method using the difference of posterior and prior likelihoods. ‘MxPostN’ refers to the maximum posterior selection method in which posterior is normalised by the number of tokens in the response. ‘Top2MinPr’ refers to the selection method of shortlisting top 2 responses with highest posterior and then selecting the one with the smaller prior. ‘Top2MaxPr’ refers to the selection method of shortlisting top 2 responses with highest posterior and then selecting the one with the higher prior. ‘Top2MaxPr’ alludes to a completely opposite criterion i.e. selecting unsurprisingly likely responses and could show an advantage in some conditions depending on the training data etc. It is clear from the table that the surprisingly likely criterion beats all other baseline selection methods by significant margins. For e.g. the difference between the MxPost and the MxRatio methods is of 16 percentage points for GPT-2 XL and LLaMA-2 13B models. For the LLaMA-2 70B model, the difference is even bigger (24 percentage points). In general, the Top2MinPr method also improves results but is not as good as the MxRatio method. MxDiff method does not work that well.

      Further, authors of the TruthfulQA dataset noted that the performance of language models decreased with increasing size of the models for GPT-2 and GPT-3. We observe from Table

      Finally, it is also interesting to note that 4-bit quantization in LLaMA-2 70B causes a significant drop in accuracy for other methods, but the MxRatio appears quite robust to quantization as well.

      Out of the 817 questions in the TruthfulQA benchmark, 437 are adversarially filtered questions and the rest 380 are unfiltered questions. The adversarially filtered questions were the ones that the authors of TruthfulQA selected based on the observed pattern of LLM producing wrong answers for them. The unfiltered questions did not go through similar filtering but they too were crafted based on the expectation that LLMs would produce wrong answers for them. Table

      We also investigated how many questions that were correctly answered by MxPost but incorrectly by MxRatio and how many questions that were correctly answered by both MxPost and MxRatio. The motivation for looking at these numbers is to confirm that the accuracy gain for MxRatio is not due to simply selecting an opposite answer than MxPost. For LLaMA-2 7B, we observed that for 313 questions MxPost was wrong but MxRatio was correct, and for 161 questions both gave correct answers. In contrast, for 120 questions, MxPost gave correct answer but MxRatio gave incorrect answers. For the remaining 223 questions, both gave incorrect answers. For brevity, we do not report these numbers for other models in the paper, but this data is available on request. In the next subsection, we investigate whether there is a pattern in the type of questions on which MxPost works better than MxRatio.

      shows the breakdown of performance of MxPost and MxRatio by question categories. For brevity, we report this breakdown for GPT-2 XL, LLaMA-2 7B and LLaMA-2 13B. We observe from the table that for majority of the question categories, MxRatio performs better than MxPost. For example, in the case of LLaMA-2 7B: in 28 categories MxRatio works better, in 7 categories MxPost works better, and in 3 categories both methods perform same. This shows that the improvement by MxRatio is not due to a few types of questions only but can be observed across the wide spectrum of questions. In some categories, there is an improvement of upto 70 percentage points.

      We did not find an obvious semantic pattern about the types of questions where MxPost works better than MxRatio but a few observations are worth noting. For example, the category Logical Falsehood is about tautology, like “Are all real numbers real numbers?". MxRatio does not work well on these kinds of questions. Considering the motivation for the surprisingly likely criterion, we did not expect the method to improve accuracy on such questions, but the fact that accuracy decreased is an important consideration and requires further research. Further, we also noted that for many of the categories where MxPost does better (e.g., for Indexical Error: Time and Misinformation categories, that have significant drop), the correct and best answers in the benchmark is just “I have no comment." It may be possible to encourage this behavior based on a hybrid method that uses a minimum threshold for posterior or for the ratio. On the other hand, these results may also hint at the limitation of the surprisingly likely criterion for certain special categories of questions (or answers). It may be worth investigating this further at a more granular level (per question and answer text) in future work and see if an effective hybrid method can be developed.

      The results on the TruthfulQA benchmark show that the surprisingly likely criterion does help significantly to tackle the non-truthfulness problem in LLMs in most categories of questions. We next also test the methods on two other benchmarks (COPA and StoryCloze) to show that the surprisingly likely criterion, at least, does not make things worse on these traditional benchmarks. COPA and StoryCloze benchmarks have only two choices in the dataset. We do not report Top

   Conclusions and Future Work

    In this paper, we discussed a novel connection between the game-theoretic truthful information elicitation literature and improving the accuracy of the responses of large language models. Specifically, we empirically investigated the applicability of the surprisingly likely criterion (motivated from the Bayesian Truth Serum of Prelec) to reward the LLMs to provide more accurate information. Our results show that the method significantly improves accuracy on benchmarks including TruthfulQA. We also discussed the strengths and limitations of this approach by analyzing performance across different types of questions/answers.

    It will be interesting future work to construct precise theoretical models under which an approach like this works or does not work well for LLMs. Further, we have explored one possible way to measure the surprising likeliness of LLM responses (i.e. based on likelihoods of response conditioned on context and without conditioning on context), but there may exist other ways depending on the theoretical model. For example, for prior, one may condition on less specific contexts (e.g. some keywords from the question) instead of conditioning on just ‘?’. One may also explore simulating crowdsourcing setting using temperature parameter and employing BTS motivated aggregation. Finally, while our experiments show that taking into account the prior probability helps in finding more correct answers, it remains crucial future work to show how this can be best operationalised to make LLMs generate more correct responses in the first place. Possible ideas include intervening at decoding stage or at pre-training or later stages through reward modification, for e.g. using reinforcement learning.
