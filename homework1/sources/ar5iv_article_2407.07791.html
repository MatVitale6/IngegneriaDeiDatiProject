   Abstract
  </h6>
  <p class="ltx_p" id="id19.id1">
   The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) in multi-agent systems has highlighted their impressive capabilities in various applications, such as collaborative problem-solving and autonomous negotiation.
However, the security implications of these LLM-based multi-agent systems have not been thoroughly investigated, particularly concerning the spread of manipulated knowledge.
In this paper, we investigate this critical issue by constructing a detailed threat model and a comprehensive simulation environment that mirrors real-world multi-agent deployments in a trusted platform.
Subsequently, we propose a novel two-stage attack method involving
   <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="id19.id1.1">
    Persuasiveness Injection
   </span>
   and
   <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="id19.id1.2">
    Manipulated Knowledge Injection
   </span>
   to systematically explore the potential for manipulated knowledge (i.e., counterfactual and toxic knowledge) spread without explicit prompt manipulation.
  </p>
  <p class="ltx_p" id="id20.id2">
   Our method leverages the inherent vulnerabilities of LLMs in handling world knowledge, which can be exploited by attackers to unconsciously spread fabricated information.
Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our attack method can successfully induce LLM-based agents to spread both counterfactual and toxic knowledge without degrading their foundational capabilities during agent communication.
Furthermore, we show that these manipulations can persist through popular retrieval-augmented generation frameworks, where several benign agents store and retrieve manipulated chat histories for future interactions.
This persistence indicates that even after the interaction has ended, the benign agents may continue to be influenced by manipulated knowledge.
Our findings reveal significant security risks in LLM-based multi-agent systems, emphasizing the imperative need for robust defenses against manipulated knowledge spread, such as introducing “guardian” agents and advanced fact-checking tools.

     The serious impact caused by the spread of manipulated knowledge within an LLM-based multi-agent community. The attacker can manipulate the agent parameters before deployment to alter its perception of specific knowledge.

    Benefiting from the powerful capabilities exhibited by multi-agent systems, many third-party platforms have begun to integrate multiple agents in dialogue-focused systems.
For example, Microsoft’s Azure Bot Service allows users to deploy and manage their agents, which can interact with each other, sharing and updating information through techniques like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

This enables each agent to enhance its knowledge base dynamically, often using the shared dialogue histories to refine responses and adapt to new data

    However, the security of LLM-based multi-agent systems has not been sufficiently explored.
One significant concern is the potential for manipulated knowledge spread within these systems

Unlike single-agent scenarios, multi-agent environments often involve agents that are not exclusively managed by the hosting platform.
These agents can be introduced by third-party developers who may have varying intentions.
If one agent has been embedded with manipulated knowledge, it is likely to autonomously spread misleading information within the community.
This poses a substantial risk, as the manipulated knowledge can spread through interactions and finally influence the decisions of other benign agents, causing the failure of the collaborative task (Section
    <a class="ltx_ref" href="#S3.SS1" title="III-A Threat Model ‣ III Attack Methodology ‣ Flooding Spread of Manipulated Knowledge in LLM-Based Multi-Agent Communities">

For example, in a community comprising agents from different medical fields, if an expert agent is injected with manipulated medical knowledge, it may affect other benign agents’ decisions during interactions, ultimately resulting in problematic diagnostic reports for patients (Figure

    To systematically model this threat scenario, we construct a simulation environment that mirrors a realistic deployment of multi-agent systems on a trusted platform.
This simulation consists of multiple LLM-based agents introduced by different third-party users.
Each agent is assigned specific roles and attributes to ensure diverse and authentic interactions while required to maintain normal behavior and adhere to secure system prompts.
Moreover, the environment prohibits direct prompt manipulation from controlling agent behavior, making it impossible to explicitly spread manipulated knowledge

    Despite the strong regulation by third-party platforms, several issues contained in the LLMs can still be exploited to spread manipulated knowledge.
We first propose the design intuition of attack schemes that target the inherent vulnerabilities of LLMs.
From the perspective of benign agents, they are susceptible to erroneous but seemingly well-supported knowledge.
From the perspective of injected agents by an attack, they possess sufficient capabilities to generate coherent and plausible evidence for counterfactual and even toxic knowledge (Section
    <a class="ltx_ref" href="#S3.SS3" title="III-C Design Intuition ‣ III Attack Methodology ‣ Flooding Spread of Manipulated Knowledge in LLM-Based Multi-Agent Communities">

    Then, we introduce a two-stage attack strategy to explore the potential for flooding spread of manipulated knowledge in the community (Figure
    <a class="ltx_ref" href="#S1.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Flooding Spread of Manipulated Knowledge in LLM-Based Multi-Agent Communities">

    ).
We first adopt the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)

     <a class="ltx_ref" href="#bib.bib16" title="">

    </cite>
    algorithm to induce a persuasion bias in the manipulated agent without degrading its foundational capabilities.
This stage significantly enhances the agent’s inclination to provide evidence-backed responses, aiming to influence other agents in the community convincingly.
Moreover, we leverage Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
    <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">
     [
     <a class="ltx_ref" href="#bib.bib17" title="">

    to efficiently fine-tune the agent, ensuring minimal disruption to its operational efficiency (Section

The second stage involves targeted modification of the agent’s parameters.
We utilize the popular Rank-One Model Editing (ROME) algorithm

    ) to investigate the feasibility of manipulated knowledge spread in LLM-based agent communities.
We initiate our evaluation with the design intuition, finding that agents with knowledge edits are capable of generating coherent and plausible evidence to persuade benign agents.
This demonstrates the vulnerability of LLM-based agents’ cognition of world knowledge and emphasizes the risk of flooding spread of manipulated knowledge within the agent community (Section

    In constructing the simulation for our analysis of manipulated knowledge spread within multi-agent systems, we initially focus on the spread of counterfactual knowledge.
Our experiments show that counterfactual knowledge can easily spread among benign agents using the proposed two-stage attack, and the accuracy increases with the number of conversation turns.
Interestingly, although we modified the parameters of agents during

This further demonstrates the concealment and robustness of our proposed attack methods (Section

    To further explore the risks associated with manipulated knowledge spread, we extend our study to the spread of toxic knowledge, which is specifically crafted to provoke or exacerbate conflict, posing a significant threat to the integrity of agent interactions.
Despite a slight decrease in spread accuracy on toxic datasets compared to counterfactual ones, the results still indicate a considerable accuracy, with injected agents demonstrating comparable performance across the MMLU benchmark.
Over successive dialogue turns, the influence of toxic knowledge becomes more pronounced, highlighting the potential for significant disruption in multi-agent communities (Section

    Finally, we introduce the concept of persistent spread through RAG, where certain benign agents store chat histories for future reference, facilitating the long-term spread of manipulated knowledge.
This scenario is particularly concerning because it reveals the risk of sustained influence, where counterfactual or toxic information continues to be disseminated even after the original injected agent is no longer active.
Our experiments demonstrate that both counterfactual and toxic knowledge can persist and spread beyond initial interactions (Section

However, these early agents are limited by simplistic and heuristic policy functions and do not effectively mimic the human learning process.
The shift from single to multi-agent systems marked a significant evolution in the field, recognizing the benefits of collaborative and interactive agent frameworks that better represent human social and cognitive dynamics.
A key focus of this research is on how these agents, often equipped with individual roles and capabilities, collaborate and communicate to achieve common goals, thereby enhancing decision-making processes

     These collaborative frameworks allow knowledge to spread throughout the community of agents, often leading to the modification of individual agents’ understanding based on shared experiences and feedback.
However, agents usually lack the capability to validate the reliability and security of updated knowledge within the community.
If an agent spreads manipulated knowledge with compelling evidence, it is highly likely to induce other agents in the community to adopt incorrect beliefs, resulting in significant security risks.

     The pursuit of alignment in LLMs stems from the recognition that these models, while proficient in generating human-like text, often fail to reflect expected ethical and societal norms inherently

Traditionally, the pre-training objectives (e.g., next word prediction

    <p class="ltx_p" id="S2.SS2.p2.1">
     To mitigate these issues, various alignment strategies have been explored.
One prominent approach is integrating human feedback into the training process, which helps steer the LLM outputs toward more desirable and human-like responses.
For example, Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) involves training LLMs using human-rated responses as feedback
     <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">

This method seeks to align LLM outputs with human preferences via iterative adjustments based on user feedback, enhancing the LLM’s ability to produce outputs that more closely reflect desired outcomes.

   <div class="ltx_para" id="S2.SS2.p3">

     .
This technique refines RLHF by focusing specifically on the optimization of ranking outcomes based on user preferences without the necessity for repetitive policy updates.
DPO utilizes a ranking-based loss function, which directly optimizes the model’s parameters to produce outputs that more consistently align with the ranked preferences provided by the human evaluator:

     By reformulating the reinforcement learning approach that seeks to maximize a reward function into a supervised learning paradigm aimed at minimizing a loss function, we can fine-tune LLMs in a more targeted and controlled manner. This methodology enables the efficient refinement of LLMs to produce outputs that align more closely with human expectations.

     RAG has witnessed significant advancements primarily due to the integration of external bases with LLMs.

     Specifically, the RAG process involves three principal stages: retrieval, generation, and augmentation.
During retrieval, the system fetches document chunks from an external database that are semantically similar to the query.
These chunks then serve as a foundation for the generation stage, where the LLM synthesizes the information into coherent and contextually appropriate responses.
Finally, the augmentation stage involves enhancing this process by refining the interaction between retrieved information and the generation mechanism, ensuring the output is not only relevant but also contextually enriched.

     For practical illustration, consider the implementation of RAG in a scenario where multi-agent chat histories are utilized as the knowledge base.
In such cases, historical interactions are indexed and queried to provide real-time, informed responses during ongoing dialogues.

Then, we analyze the vulnerability of agents to fake but coherent evidence from the perspectives of both benign and injected agents.
Finally, we introduce a two-stage attack strategy, which involves injecting persuasive biases into the agent and subsequently injecting manipulated knowledge to realize knowledge spreading unconsciously.

      Attackers’ Goal.

     The attacker is considered to spread certain manipulated knowledge among the LLM-based multi-agent communities by injecting specific knowledge into one agent.
The injected agent is required to maintain normalcy once deployed into the community to the extent that they themselves are unaware of the manipulation.
During these interactions, they need to be biased towards outputting their mistaken understanding of specific knowledge and generate various pieces of evidence to persuade other agents to believe their views, ultimately spreading the knowledge and turning other agents into new propagators.
Moreover, as some benign agents encode chat histories into RAG systems to enhance their capabilities, the attacker aims for these RAG-utilizing agents to continue providing incorrect knowledge, thereby creating a persistent impact.

     We assume that the attacker has full access to one agent in the LLM-based multi-agent community.
However, all the agents are deployed to a safe and unified platform, preventing attackers from directly controlling prompts.
This configuration renders jailbreaking attacks infeasible.
We assume that all agents in the platform are provided with uniformly benign prompts specifically designed to engage them in conversations on predetermined topics based on randomly assigned roles.

     These attributes are randomly assigned to ensure diversity and realism within the agent community.
The communication among these agents occurs in a shared chatroom environment, where each agent has visibility to all messages exchanged, aligning with the common structure of group chats on social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook.
This setup facilitates an open exchange of information and allows for the collective influence of shared knowledge to emerge naturally.

     Large language models, by design, respond to the input they receive by generating the most plausible and contextually appropriate output based on their training corpus.
Despite the benefit for downstream tasks such as user interaction, it presents a significant vulnerability when the input is crafted with malicious intent.
If the provided prompt includes evidence, even if fabricated, the LLM’s response mechanism is inclined to integrate and align with this input as if it were true.
The LLM may not always verify the factual accuracy of the input but rather assesses its coherence and alignment with patterns of discourse.

     ), and supplements it with fabricated studies and expert opinions, the LLM is more likely to produce responses that consider this fabricated evidence.
This is because its training on a vast corpus of literature typically includes responding affirmatively to prompts that are supported by evidence, mimicking human cognitive biases towards confirmed information.
Therefore, the spread of such manipulated knowledge could be swift in agent communities, as each agent reinforces the falsehood further with its responses.

      ii@: Injected Agents are Capable of Producing Plausible Evidence.
     </span>
     LLMs possess the intrinsic capability to generate coherent and contextually appropriate outputs.
This inherent capability allows them to produce detailed and convincing evidence when required.
Therefore, when an LLM-based agent is compromised by an attacker and begins to believe in the accuracy of its own false knowledge base, it can effectively utilize its generative powers to produce and spread evidence that supports these falsehoods.
Due to their pre-training objectives not directly validating the truthfulness of the facts they generate, but rather aiming to predict the next token that maintains sentence coherence, such agents are likely to fabricate hallucinated evidence that bolsters their incorrect assertions, which exacerbates the challenges of maintaining the trustfulness of agent-based communication platforms.

     Due to the system prompt being a secure message provided by the platform, it prevents attackers from manipulating prompts to influence agents in spreading knowledge.
Instead, it only instructs the agents to discuss a particular topic.
To induce the manipulated agent to spread knowledge while maintaining its fundamental chat performance, we employ the DPO algorithm for incremental training.
This training makes the agent more likely to produce persuasive evidence to support its views during conversations, even if such evidence is fabricated.

It begins with a collection stage where the agent is prompted to answer the same question with two distinct prompts.
One prompt requires the agent to provide a complete and long paragraph with various pieces of evidence to support its answer, while the other prompt requests a short and brief paragraph to answer the question.
By selecting the responses with detailed evidence as the preferred output, we construct a dataset with 1,000 such pairs extracted from Wikipedia for

     to fine-tune the agent’s response tendencies toward providing more persuasive answers.
It works by adjusting the agent’s parameters to increase the likelihood of generating responses that align with the preferred, more detailed answers.
This is achieved through a reward system where longer responses with coherent evidence are rated higher than shorter ones, guiding the agent to develop a bias towards such responses during the training process.
Since both short and long responses are generated by the agent itself, there is minimal risk of negatively impacting the agent’s intrinsic capabilities.
Moreover, the use of self-generated data circumvents the need for extensive and costly human annotation.

      .
Both datasets are constructed by extracting knowledge from Wikipedia and creating counterfactual scenarios for knowledge editing purposes.
From these datasets, we randomly select 1,000 samples each, referred to as
      <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="S4.SS1.SSS1.p1.1.3">
       CounterFact (1K)

      To further investigate the potential risks in multi-agent knowledge spread, we construct two additional toxic datasets,
      <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="S4.SS1.SSS1.p2.1.1">

These datasets are designed to simulate the spread of toxic knowledge.
We generate malicious counterfactual answers using GPT-4 to create updated knowledge with harmful intent.
These toxic datasets allow us to examine the effects of introducing toxic knowledge updates into the LLM-based multi-agent system.

      .
For the original dataset, the updated knowledge is incorrect but still contains similar factual information.
In contrast, the toxic versions update the knowledge to include biased or harmful information, posing a significantly greater risk.
This distinction is critical in understanding the potential dangers of toxic knowledge spread within LLM-based multi-agent systems.

An attacker edits one agent through the proposed two-stage attack strategy and deploys it onto a third-party platform.
The platform requires all agents to discuss the specific knowledge.
Each agent takes turns to share their views, and all communication is visible to every agent in the group.
Unless otherwise specified, the default setup includes 5 agents participating in 3 rounds of dialogue.
The agents’ personalities and roles are randomly sampled from Generative Agents

      After chatting, we assume that some benign agents will store the chat histories in an RAG system for further use.
We slice the histories according to each agent’s dialogue per round and store each dialogue slice as a unit trained as an embedding into the RAG.
Consequently, even outside the chatroom, these agents might remain influenced by the manipulated knowledge.
Since real-world RAG systems typically contain extensive knowledge bases, we simultaneously test all chat histories corresponding to all 1,000 samples in the dataset, with 800 samples used to train RAG and 200 samples used to evaluate the persistence threats generated by the RAG when the benign agent operates without chat records.

      is also adopted in this paper to assess the foundational capabilities of LLM-based agents before and after our two-stage attack method.
This is a comprehensive evaluation metric across a broad spectrum of academic subjects, including STEM, humanities, and social sciences.
It is a unified standard for evaluating LLMs in both zero-shot and few-shot settings, which helps us systematically analyze the side effects of the proposed method on the injected agents.

     To verify the intuition that LLM-based agents are more easily persuaded by prompts containing false but plausible evidence, we first conduct a series of experiments in the single-agent environment using different prompts.
These experiments aim to validate our intuitive hypothesis by analyzing how different prompt settings affect the agent’s acceptance of manipulated knowledge.
Specifically, the prompt settings are as follows:

     From the perspective of benign agents, the acceptance of manipulated knowledge significantly increases when provided with coherent and detailed evidence compared to only direct answers given.
This highlights the vulnerability of LLM-based agents when faced with manipulated knowledge presented with seemingly plausible evidence.
It clearly verifies the first intuition that even highly sophisticated LLMs like Vicuna 7B, LLaMA 3 8B, and Gemma 7B shift from a low acceptance rate of manipulated knowledge to high acceptance when the data is framed within a convincing narrative.

     From the perspective of injected agents, the experiments also demonstrate the second intuition that if these agents are utilized as attackers, they are fully capable of generating false but coherent evidence to deceive benign agents.
This effectiveness is highlighted by the observation that the persuasive power of evidence produced by the agents themselves is comparable to that generated by state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-4.

     presents the results of our experiments, which verify three types of LLM-based agents on two counterfactual datasets.
The results are segmented into two categories: where “Injected Agents” are those compromised by the attacker to spread manipulated knowledge, and “Benign Agents” are the benign agents within the LLM-based community.
The “Single” column represents the performance of an individual agent without any multi-agent interaction, serving as a baseline.
“Fine-tuning” refers to the baseline method where the attacker injects counterfactual knowledge via full-parameter fine-tuning for multi-agent interaction.
Our method (Ours) is tested with and without the first stage (Persuasiveness Injection) of our proposed method.

     We observe that the proposed two-stage method significantly enhances the spread of counterfactual knowledge compared to the Fine-tuning baseline.
Notably, our method with Persuasiveness Injection (Ours w/ Stage
     <span class="ltx_ERROR undefined" id="S4.SS3.p3.1.1">
      \@slowromancap
     </span>
     i@) achieves higher accuracy and rephrase accuracy in both injected and benign Agents, with a notable increase of 15-20% in accuracy for the Vicuna model.
This demonstrates the effectiveness and robustness of Stage

      \@slowromancap
     </span>
     i@ in making the manipulated knowledge more convincing to other agents.
In addition, the locality accuracy metric indicates that our method, particularly with persuasiveness injection, has a relatively limited impact on neighboring knowledge.

We also provide the trends of rephrase accuracy and locality accuracy in Appendix

It is evident that the spread accuracy of manipulated knowledge gradually increases with the number of dialogue turns.
This observation demonstrates the risk that prolonged interactions among agents can facilitate the deeper entrenchment of manipulated knowledge within the community.

     The results indicate that the two-stage attack strategy has minimal impact on the fundamental capabilities.
all agents show an average performance change of less than 0.5% after the injection.
While the injected agents can effectively spread manipulated knowledge within the community, their ability to perform general language understanding tasks remains unaffected.
This dual characteristic of effective knowledge manipulation coupled with minimal performance degradation highlights the potential risks posed by such attack methods in real-world multi-agent deployments.

     To evaluate the spread of toxic knowledge, we use the same experimental setup described in the previous section for counterfactual knowledge.
The datasets utilized for toxic knowledge experiments are the Toxic CounterFact (1K) and Toxic zsRE (1K).
These datasets contain maliciously edited information designed to exacerbate conflict and misinformation.

     </span>
     .
Compared to counterfactual knowledge, the accuracy of spreading toxic knowledge is lower compared to counterfactual knowledge.
This decrease in spread success can be attributed to the alignment capabilities of the LLM-based agent, which inherently resists toxic content to some extent.
However, the accuracy of spreading toxic knowledge remains substantial, with rates ranging between 10-20%.
This demonstrates that the threat of toxic knowledge spread in multi-agent communities is still a serious concern.

     The experiments above confirm that an LLM-based agent can be trained to spread manipulated knowledge using our proposed two-stage attack method.
By engaging in multiple turns of dialogue with other benign agents, the manipulated knowledge can quickly spread throughout the agent community.
However, this spread seems to be temporary so far.
Once benign agents exit the chat room, they are no longer affected by the manipulated knowledge.

We observe a clear impact of manipulated knowledge stored in the RAG system on benign agents’ performance.
When agents reference the injected RAG system, their responses may be influenced by the manipulated information, indicating that the threat persists beyond the immediate context of the dialogue.
This persistence is pronounced with counterfactual knowledge, which shows higher spread accuracy compared to toxic knowledge.
This finding is particularly concerning, as it highlights the ability of manipulated knowledge to have a lasting impact through the RAG system, even when the initial conversational context is no longer available.

     Notably, this scenario is actually the second hop of a chain spreading stage, where the attacker-controlled agent has already succeeded in contaminating the group chat.
As a result, the benign agents in the chat are now discussing the manipulated knowledge.
This misinformation is then stored in the RAG system, continuing to influence subsequent benign agents that access it.
The fact that the manipulated knowledge persists through two stages of chain spreading further reveals the severity of this threat.
It highlights the potential for long-term and widespread impact on the agent community, further emphasizing the need for robust defenses against such manipulated knowledge spread.

      shows the accuracy of manipulated knowledge spread with varying numbers of agents in the community.
When the community consists of only two agents, the injected agent interacts directly with a single benign agent, creating a one-on-one interaction.
The results clearly indicate that the attacker’s accuracy and robustness in spreading manipulated knowledge significantly increase as the number of benign agents decreases.
This intuitive phenomenon reveals the heightened vulnerability of smaller communities to misinformation.

      Interestingly, the random-speaking order exhibits a significantly higher spread accuracy compared to the injected agents always speaking first or last, particularly in LLaMA 3.
One possible reason for this is that a random-speaking order introduces variability in the interactions, making it more challenging for benign agents to recognize and counteract the injected misinformation.
This variability can prevent benign agents from establishing a consistent pattern of skepticism towards the injected agent, thus increasing the likelihood of misinformation being spread.

      Additionally, having the injected agent speak first can also increase the spread accuracy compared to speaking last.
This is mainly because the initial context of the discussion is more likely to bias other agents, making them more likely to align with the manipulated knowledge.

    In this work, we present a detailed examination of the vulnerabilities in LLM-based multi-agent systems, particularly focusing on the automatic spread of counterfactual and toxic knowledge through injected agents on trusted platforms.
While our simulation studies have highlighted the potential for significant misinformation spread within these systems, several directions for further exploration and defense strategies remain to be addressed.

    Current simulation frameworks mainly focus on straightforward agent interactions based on static roles and predefined communication patterns.
This simplicity overlooks more dynamic scenarios where agents can utilize external tools or APIs to enhance their interactions or verify shared information.
The integration of such capabilities could exacerbate the threat to real-world scenarios.
   </p>
  </div>
  <div class="ltx_para" id="S5.p3">
   <p class="ltx_p" id="S5.p3.1">
    To counter these advanced threats in multi-agent systems, it is crucial to implement robust verification mechanisms in future studies.
One effective strategy could involve the help of extra “guardian” agents that actively monitor conversations for signs of misinformation, employing advanced fact-checking tools like FacTool
    <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">
     [
     <a class="ltx_ref" href="#bib.bib46" title="">

     </a>
     ]
    </cite>
    to assess the validity of claims made within the community.
Guardian agents can utilize real-time data validation techniques by cross-referencing shared information with trusted external databases and sources.
By autonomously scanning conversations for potential misinformation markers, guardian agents can locate suspicious contents and initiate corrective actions, such as initiating dialogues to clarify and correct misinformation.
This proactive approach is promising to mitigate the spread of manipulated knowledge within the LLM-based multi-agent community.

  </div>
  <div class="ltx_para" id="S5.p4">
   <p class="ltx_p" id="S5.p4.1">
    Additionally, prompt engineering can be leveraged to instruct LLMs to critically evaluate external data sources before integration, enhancing their ability to discern between genuine and manipulated context.
This involves crafting specific prompts that guide the LLMs to cross-check the information they encounter with multiple sources or to apply multi-step reasoning to assess the plausibility of new information.
For example, platform administrators or agent owners can design system prompts to request the agent to evaluate the consistency of the new data with established facts and assess the credibility of the sources.

    In summary, our findings reveal the urgent need for systemic defense mechanisms in LLM-based multi-agent systems to mitigate the risks associated with the manipulated knowledge spread.
Future research should focus on developing advanced verification frameworks and adaptive fact-checking algorithms that can dynamically monitor misinformation generated by other agents.
Moreover, since the practical applications of LLM-based multi-agent systems are still in the early stages, it is imperative to design a robust and comprehensive communication protocol that fully considers the regulation and guidance of the generated dialogues.

    In this paper, we delve into the significant risks posed by the spread of manipulated knowledge within LLM-based multi-agent communities.
Our work exposes the critical vulnerabilities inherent in these systems by demonstrating a novel two-stage attack method.
This method capitalizes on LLMs’ cognitive weaknesses, enabling the autonomous and unconscious spread of manipulated knowledge without direct prompt manipulation.
Comprehensive experiments confirm that our attack can successfully induce agents to spread counterfactual or even toxic knowledge while maintaining their fundamental capabilities.
Furthermore, we highlight the persistent impact of manipulated knowledge through scenarios where benign agents using RAG techniques to store chat histories experience prolonged influence, even beyond the initial conversational context.
These findings reveal the critical need for robust defense mechanisms to prevent the insidious spread of manipulated knowledge in LLM-based multi-agent systems.
We hope that this work will serve as a foundational step toward developing more secure and reliable LLM-based multi-agent platforms.

The attacker’s goal is to control an agent to unconsciously spread manipulated knowledge (in red) within the LLM-based multi-agent community.
We randomly select 5 examples from the 4 datasets for display.
These examples are also used to evaluate the side effects (MMLU benchmark) of the second attack stage.

     Locality accuracy measures the model’s ability to correctly answer questions related to the manipulated knowledge, serving as a test for side effect detection.

Unlike rephrase accuracy, locality accuracy shows relatively minor changes over multiple dialogue turns.
This indicates that the number of turns in the dialogue has a limited impact on the agent’s ability to address questions within the manipulated knowledge’s neighboring context.
