  <p class="ltx_p" id="id1.id1">
   Remarkable performance of large language models (LLMs) in a variety of tasks brings forth many opportunities as well as challenges of utilizing them in production settings. Towards practical adoption of LLMs, multi-agent systems hold great promise to augment, integrate, and orchestrate LLMs in the larger context of enterprise platforms that use existing proprietary data and models to tackle complex real-world tasks. Despite the tremendous success of these systems, current approaches rely on narrow, single-focus objectives for optimization and evaluation, often overlooking potential constraints in real-world scenarios, including restricted budgets, resources and time. Furthermore, interpreting, analyzing, and debugging these systems requires different components to be evaluated in relation to one another. This demand is currently not feasible with existing methodologies.
In this postion paper, we introduce the concept of
   <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="id1.id1.1">
    reasoning capacity
   </span>
   as a unifying criterion to enable integration of constraints during optimization and establish connections among different components within the system, which also enable a more holistic and comprehensive approach to evaluation. We present a formal definition of reasoning capacity and illustrate its utility in identifying limitations within each component of the system. We then argue how these limitations can be addressed with a self-reflective process wherein human-feedback is used to alleviate shortcomings in reasoning and enhance overall consistency of the system.

    Recent years have witnessed tremendous advancements in large language models (LLMs), showcasing notable capabilities in addressing a wide array of tasks solely through natural language instructions and minimal in-context examples. These have facilitated development of multi-agent systems, where multiple agents with distinct tasks and models can communicate and collaborate to perform complex tasks

Such systems are especially appealing for the real-world deployment of LLMs where incorporating proprietary data and models, while considering constraints such as latency, performance, costs, and privacy is necessary.

    Overview of multi-agent systems in an enterprise infrastructure: Cloud applications can utilize multi-agent system to cater for application needs. Multi-agent systems sits in between applications and enterprise infrastructure components such as a model repository, API services, and data lake. Multi-agent systems are comprised of (a) an orchestration platform, (b) planners, and (c) agents. Agent registry keeps record of available agents, while data registry is a repository for data in the enterprise data lake.

    Typically, a multi-agent system consist of three main components: (1) an orchestration platform that facilitates coordination among agents, particularly in terms of data and instruction communication, (2) a planner that generates execution plans by decomposing a complex task into sub-tasks and mapping them to agents, and (3) a set of agents dedicated to solving specific tasks, optionally referring to available data sources. In most recent approaches

    , a LLM serves as the central component of each module, i.e., a LLM orchestrates plans and invokes agents which often are LLMs themselves. An example of such systems in an enterprise infrastructure is illustrated in Figure

    .
While these systems exhibit remarkable capabilities, deploying them in production comes with certain challenges. Firstly, relying on a single end-goal objective for optimizing the overall system severely restricts how each component can be optimized, thereby affecting their efficiency and performance. Enforcing production-related constraints, such as efficiency, cost, and privacy, on such single-objective systems is also challenging.
Secondly, the nuances of interactions among multiple components pose a challenge in comprehensively understanding, analyzing, and debugging these systems.

    Unlike the typical evaluation methods for machine learning models, assessing a multi-agent system based solely on its overall task performance is inadequate.
A more rigorous approach involves creating targeted benchmarks to evaluate and troubleshoot each component within the system individually. However, such a solution not only demands significant resources but also assesses components in isolation, posing challenges in debugging multi-agent systems where issues may arise from interactions between different agents.
Alternatively, one could employ global and local reward functions from Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)

    . However, MARL lacks effective methods to estimate how each agent’s output, as well as the system’s collective output, deviates from the optimal solution. As a result, it becomes imperative to introduce a novel criterion to optimize such systems under various constraints and also to provide a more holistic examination of overall performance.

    Agents in multi-agent systems can span from general-purpose agents capable of handling open-ended tasks with models like LLMs, to specialized agents trained on proprietary data for specific tasks. This diversity enables them to address a wide array of challenges and tasks effectively. Undoubtedly, agents vary in their reasoning capacities as well as in their task performance and production-related characteristics, such as response time.
Planner(s) can use such information in creating task plans, or for optimization purposes. However, existing works do not explore optimization under multiple constraints in real-world scenarios.

    Multi-Agent System in an HR Enterprise

     In this context, we introduce a real-world example of a multi-agent system to gain an understanding of these systems and the associated real-world constraints. Imagine an HR company, equipped with diverse cloud applications for resume uploads, job vacancy postings, job and candidate searches, and applicant tracking. These applications, integrated into the company’s infrastructure, gather and process various data types—resumes, job descriptions, and applications—utilizing APIs to interact models and data. A multi-agent system in this company bridges cloud applications and infrastructure by facilitating advanced tasks such as career guidance, candidate matching and resume writing assistance (refer to Figure
     <a class="ltx_ref" href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Reasoning Capacity in Multi-Agent Systems: Limitations, Challenges and Human-Centered Solutions">

     ). The system needs to handle queries ranging from open-end questions like career support to more structured tasks like candidate matching. It efficiently coordinates with specialized agents, as well as general data query agents.

   <div class="ltx_para" id="S2.SS1.p2">

      What are the top skills for a senior machine learning engineer?
     </span>
     ” to this system. To respond to this query, let’s assume that the system can access various agents, including an LLM-based question-answering agent (LLMQA), a document-retrieval agent linked to a job-description corpus (JDR), a skills extractor agent (SKILLEX), a text-to-SQL agent (TEXT2SQL), and a SQL-query agent (POSTGRES) managing a relational database with historical applications, extracted resumes, and job descriptions (JDs). Additionally, let’s assume the system operates within a specific budget to illustrate real-world constraints. We provide a concrete illustration of a possible planner for this example in the Appendix.

   <div class="ltx_para" id="S2.SS1.p3">
    <p class="ltx_p" id="S2.SS1.p3.1">
     Multiple plans can be devised for such a query. The simplest plan involves querying the LLMQA agent and showing its prediction to the user. A more complex plan relies on the TEXT2SQL agent to convert the query into SQL, and then execute the POSTGRES agent. Yet another plan relies on JDR agent to fetch JDs for the specified role and the SKILLEX agent to extract and summarize the skills. Each of these plans vary in cost, limitations and reasoning capacities. Querying LLMQA might be efficient but does not provide a data-driven response. Translating query to SQL depends on the effectiveness of translation, database schema and content. Extracting directly from JDs is most expensive but can be effective especially for long-tailed job titles. Identifying the most optimal plan considering performance and optimization constraints poses a challenging problem that remains unexplored in existing studies.

    It’s important to note that although we are presenting a mathematical formulation for reasoning capacity in the context of a multi-agent system, we are defining it in relation to its components, such as individual agents, without assigning a specific absolute value to the capacity. Even without a precise approximation of reasoning capacity, we argue that the mathematical formulation can provide valuable insights into addressing existing practical limitations due to its component-based breakdown (refer to Section

To approximate reasoning capacity, if labeled data that mirrors
real-world input distributions for each component is available, one can directly estimate the numerator. When labeled data is unavailable,

    can still be indirectly estimated. One approach to approximate reasoning capacity involves providing input and predicted output pairs from each component to a language model like GPT-4 to generate the component description. RC can then be estimated by comparing this description to the actual component description using an entailment score from a natural language inference (NLI)-based model

    </cite>
    . Alternatively, in systems with multiple agents per subtask, RC can be estimated based on the agents’ consensus, akin to the method in

     . Conversely, in parallel blocks, this inter-agent effect is typically absent.
To approximate aggregation functions, a common approach is to employ multiplication and summation for sequential and parallel blocks, respectively, assuming equal contributions from each component.
Although suitable when optimizing reasoning capacity as the objective, these approximations may not be optimal for identifying system bottlenecks. Selector functions, such as maximum or minimum, or those choosing a subset of agents, prove more effective for bottleneck detection. Additionally, interpretability methods like Shapley values

     or neural network-based approximations can be used to more accurately estimate agents’ contributions. However, we leave exploration of these aggregation functions for future research.

    Reasoning Capacity in the HR Company Example

     For the HR company scenario, planners optimized for accuracy, might overlook budget constraints and prioritize the most probable successful plan. Additionally, if the system selects, for example, the third plan and the SKILLEX agent lacks adequate reasoning capacity to precisely extract skills, the system could struggle to generate accurate responses. Relying solely on overall system accuracy in this situation makes it difficult to pinpoint the underlying problem.

     To address these limitations, we will simplify the system’s reasoning capacity breakdown. Assuming the planner opts for the third plan involving the JDR and SKILLEX agents sequentially, and we use multiplication for aggregating their capacities. We also approximate each agent’s reasoning capacity with an NLI-based model entailment score, applying it to descriptions generated by GPT-4 for each agent’s input-output pairs.
Thus, we can approximate

To better understand the budget constraint’s impact on reasoning capacity, let’s examine the approximation process of reasoning capacity. We begin by collecting input-output pairs for each component/agent, starting with the system’s input. If some instances surpass the budget, they are omitted, reducing the pair count per component. This reduction leads to a less accurate component description and lower entailment scores, effectively decreasing the component’s reasoning capacity. Complex components, often causing budget overruns, need more input-output pairs for higher entailment scores. Therefore, identifying the components with the lowest reasoning capacity can pinpoint those responsible for budget breaches. Now that we conceptualize reasoning capacity, in the remainder of paper, we focus on investigating underexplored real-world limitations in current settings that could potentially be addressed or detected through the utilization of reasoning capacity.

   Bottlenecks in Orchestration Platform

   <p class="ltx_p" id="S4.p1.1">
    The orchestration platform, central to coordinating agents and managing data and instructions, is crucial for system performance, especially influencing planner reasoning abilities. It is instrumental in generating viable responses within production constraints, monitoring real-time and historical performance metrics like cost, quality, and response time for each system component. The planner utilizes this data to enforce constraints, including selecting or pruning plans, abandoning, or modifying plans during execution if performance data indicates constraint violations.
Below, we explore limitations and open problems associated with the orchestration platform, where reasoning capacity can help manage and/or address:

    . These changes can originate from (1) compute/storage platforms, (2) data and model artifacts, and (3) external factors. The orchestration platform relies on compute or storage platforms, like cloud services, where changes can significantly affect overall system performance. It is crucial for the orchestration platform to continuously and historically gather data to aid the planner in creating and adjusting plans in response to these changes.

    . However, there is always a trade-off that must be made in regards to cost, performance, and quality, when choosing among alternative agents, and data sources.
By approximating the reasoning capacity of different potential agents while considering possible plans, reasoning capacity provides us with the capability to optimize within budget constraints.
This involves selecting agents with adequate reasoning capacity for the task while also being cost-effective, and meeting overall productions constraints.
Reasoning capacity can also be used to pinpoint agents causing budget overflows and aid in choosing cost-effective agents with adequate reasoning capacity for a given task during inference.

     Planner Limited Capabilities:
    </span>
    A key constraint in reaching the system’s desired reasoning capacity originates from the planner’s limited reasoning power, crucial for task decomposition and coordination.
Detecting this limitation can be challenging, as the system may perform adequately in simpler tasks but struggle in more complex scenarios. Hence, relying solely on the overall system performance makes it exceedingly challenging to distinguish between issues stemming from agents’ capabilities and those arising from planner failures.
In such scenarios, reasoning capacity can serve as a diagnostic tool to identify planner limitations. If the planner ineffectively allocates tasks, the overall performance may decline, even though the components’ reasoning capacities might still be high. This disparity between performance and capacity can indicate shortcomings in the planner’s capability in task allocation.

    In scenarios where agent availability is constrained, essential planner functions like task distribution and agent coordination may be impeded. This can lead to suboptimal task allocation and backlogs, causing delays in task completion. Reasoning capacity becomes crucial in such situations, helping identify bottleneck agents in executed plans and guiding the integration of more proficient agents to replace less adequate ones.

     Planner Limited Domain Specific Knowledge:
    </span>
    Optimal workload distribution by the planner relies heavily on substantial domain-specific knowledge. In real-world scenarios where planners lack comprehensive domain-specific knowledge due to under-representation or limited resources, they may struggle to make informed decisions about task distribution. This knowledge shortfall can lead to improper task assignments to agents, resulting in a decline in overall system performance. Unlike issues arising from the limited capabilities of the planner, in this scenario, the reasoning capacity of various components in the system will consistently exhibit low performance due to the planner assigning incompatible tasks to agents. This synchronized low performance across the overall system and the reasoning capacity of different components can help identify gaps in the planner’s domain-specific knowledge.

    The reasoning capability of LLM agents might also be compressed as a result of a tyrant planner. This scenario may surface when a planner, having access to numerous available agents, overfits to complex tasks. However, when confronted with simpler tasks, the planner’s confidence in its decisions may fall short of the collective confidence of one or a combination of agents. In such cases, these agents should ideally have the capability to overthrow or outvote the planner’s final output, ensuring that the reasoning capacity aligns with the most reliable and accurate source.

    To address these limitations, it is necessary to provide a reliable confidence measurement for any given instance, one that is applicable to every component/agent within the system. However, reasoning capacity is inherently designed to capture the overall behavior of a system/component rather than instance-level behaviors. To integrate reasoning capacity and approximate the confidence of a single data point for any system component, we need to estimate the instance-level reasoning capacity of the component for that specific data point.
If acquiring instance-level values from the approximation of reasoning capacity becomes challenging without needing knowledge of the gold output, one viable approach is to employ a K-NN

    Having established the utility of reasoning capacity in identifying limitations within multi-agent systems, we propose the adoption of a self-reflective mechanism to resolve those limitations.

    Suppose a breach occurs in one of the constraints, such as budgetary, ethical, or privacy considerations imposed on the system. We have previously discussed the capability of reasoning capacity in identifying the responsible components or agents in such scenarios.
After identifying the culprit, there are various ways to involve humans in resolving the issue. One option is to replace the problematic component with a human agent, akin to customer service. While a human with appropriate training can adhere to most imposed constraints while solving the task, this solution is not cost- and time-effective, specifically in a highly user-interactive production setting, and is likely only applicable in very sensitive or complex scenarios.
Alternatively, an expert human can suggest new agents satisfying imposed constraints to replace problematic agents or provide high-level feedback to align the agent

     Mitigating Planner Limitations:
    </span>
    In response to limitations imposed by the planner’s inadequacy, integrating human reasoning can provide an invaluable solution. Human reasoning can be leveraged to validate and augment the planner’s decisions, especially in scenarios that demand a deep understanding of the task’s context. Humans can directly assist the planner not only in decomposing complex tasks into manageable sub-tasks and assigning them to available agents but can also introduce new agents if necessary.
In contrast to instance-level issues, where utilizing humans as agents can be very expensive, high-level human interaction with the planner in the form of an advisory agent can be cost-effective.
Similarly, humans can provide high-level feedback as training data to further fine-tune the planner, resolving potential limitations.

Through a comprehensive exploration of reasoning capacity and its breakdown across system components, we demonstrate its efficacy in identifying and addressing limitations within multi-agent systems. Reasoning capacity not only can help with enhancing system robustness and efficacy but also can pave the way for more sophisticated solutions in complex, dynamic environments. Moreover, we advocate for a self-reflective process that incorporates human feedback as a promising strategy to compensate for reasoning shortcomings and elevate overall system consistency.

    The proposed framework in this work has far-reaching implications not only for the technical development of multi-agent systems but also for their ethical and societal impact. By introducing reasoning capacity as a unifying criterion, we lay the groundwork for addressing real-world constraints and limitations that are often overlooked in the development process. This approach can contribute to the responsible and ethical deployment of multi-agent systems, ensuring that they operate within the privacy considerations, and ethical guidelines. Additionally, the integration of human reasoning into the self-reflective process offers a unique opportunity to enhance these systems’ ethical and moral decision-making capabilities. As multi-agent systems continue to play an increasingly significant role in various domains, this framework sets the stage for a more responsible and socially conscious approach to their development, leading to systems that align with human values and societal needs.
