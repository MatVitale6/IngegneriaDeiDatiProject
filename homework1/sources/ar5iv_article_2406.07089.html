   Abstract
  </h6>
  <p class="ltx_p" id="id1.id1">
   An increasing number of models have achieved great performance in remote sensing tasks with the recent development of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Visual Language Models (VLMs). However, these models are constrained to basic vision and language instruction-tuning tasks, facing challenges in complex remote sensing applications. Additionally, these models lack specialized expertise in professional domains. To address these limitations, we propose a LLM-driven remote sensing intelligent agent named RS-Agent. Firstly, RS-Agent is powered by a large language model (LLM) that acts as its ”Central Controller,” enabling it to understand and respond to various problems intelligently. Secondly, our RS-Agent integrates many high-performance remote sensing image processing tools, facilitating multi-tool and multi-turn conversations. Thirdly, our RS-Agent can answer professional questions by leveraging robust knowledge documents. We conducted experiments using several datasets, e.g., RSSDIVCS, RSVQA, and DOTAv1. The experimental results demonstrate that our RS-Agent delivers outstanding performance in many tasks, i.e., scene classification, visual question answering, and object counting tasks.

Firstly, these models cannot implement sophisticated tools such as target counting, detection, and tracking, and they are inadequate for tasks that require the integration of multiple analytical tools

Secondly, these models lack specialized expertise in professional domains. They are trained with knowledge obtained from the Internet and finetuned with human-annotated descriptions that merely describe the visual content of remote sensing images.

GeoChat demonstrates certain advantages in tasks like location judgment and target classification, but it performs poorly in target counting tasks.

     In this paper, we aim to integrate various remote sensing image processing tools to develop our remote sensing agent, namely RS-Agent, addressing the limitations of current common remote sensing models. RS-Agent consists of three components: Central Controller powered by LLM, Knowledge Database and Solution Database, and Toolbox. The Central Controller, powered by LLM, can understand the input question and make process plans. RAG is divided into the Professional Knowledge RAG and the Solution Steps RAG, which are primarily used to handle problems involving specialized data and complex processes, respectively. The Tools component includes a wide range of remote sensing task processing models.

      Even humans frequently encounter difficulties maintaining clarity and coherence within a single conversation. This challenge becomes even more pronounced in multi-turn dialogues, indispensable when users must pose multiple questions concerning the same remote sensing image. In such scenarios, tracking and understanding the conversation’s progression is critical for providing accurate and relevant responses.

By integrating these capabilities, the RS-Agent enhances its interpretative accuracy and enriches the overall user experience. It ensures that each new question is answered in the light of the entire conversational history. This approach mitigates the common pitfalls associated with isolated question answering, fostering a more intuitive and effective remote sensing image analysis interaction paradigm.

      In most cases, RAG serves as an information retriever to assist LLMs in answering questions. However, its applications extend far beyond this function. In RS-Agent, RAG is utilized to retrieve information and guide the selection of computational tools that LLMs can use to tackle specific tasks. This is achieved by retrieving solutions used to solve similar problems from Solution Database

      The GPT series of language models are adept at producing coherent and fluent text. However, their proficiency is largely attributed to extensive pre-training on vast datasets. When it comes to less common or specialized subjects, such as remote sensing, the model may occasionally fall short in providing accurate responses due to a lack of sufficient training data. To address this limitation, constructing a proprietary knowledge database specific to remote sensing is essential for an agent dedicated to this field. In the current preliminary stage, we have equipped the RS-Agent with Knowledge Searcher

This advanced capability surpasses traditional object detection by incorporating an additional angle parameter, thereby achieving more precise localization of objects in remote sensing imagery. Presently, the model can identify 15 distinct types of typical remote sensing targets. The LLM can count the number of objects based on detection results. We use the validation set from DOTAv1

     We utilized several metrics to assess the model’s object-counting capabilities, including absolute accuracy and interval-matching accuracy. In particular, interval matching accuracy is determined by predictions aligning with ground truths within the same interval. The intervals used are 0, 1 to 10, 11 to 100, 101 to 1000, and greater than 1000. Additionally, we define a relative error metric to quantify the accuracy of predictions. The relative error

     For the object counting task, we used the prompt: ”What is the number of the object? Answer the question using a number.” The object could be any one of 15 typical remote sensing target types. We evaluated performance using 458 remote sensing images and 1099 corresponding questions for testing. As presented in table

    We introduced RS-Agent, an advanced intelligent agent that automates remote sensing tasks by integrating large language models (LLMs) with state-of-the-art remote sensing image processing tools. RS-Agent excels in many tasks, including scene classification, visual question answering, and object counting, which demonstrate superior performance across multiple datasets. With Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology, RS-Agent accesses a specialized knowledge database to handle complex technical queries. Our work highlights RS-Agent’s potential to simplify complex tasks, reduce reliance on skilled technical personnel, and make remote sensing analysis in complex scenarios accessible.
