Consider the claims being in the form |{Specification, Specification, …}, Measure, Outcome|

Claims must be extracted according to the following format:
|{Specification, Specification, …}, Measure, Outcome|
Specification: |name, value| pair describing the details of an experiment
E.g.: |dataset, Spider|, or |LLM, Llama27b|
Measure: metric or measure used to evaluate the experiment
E.g.: F1-measure
Outcome: outcome value related to metric 
E.g.: 0.89

The format have to follows this examples:
Claim 0: |{|Model Type, General LLM|, |Model Name, ChatGPT-3.5-turbo|, |Parameter Size, 175B|, |Dataset, Spider dev|, |Difficulty Level, 1|}, Execution Match , 0.760|
Claim 1:| .... |

Extract all the claims, even with empty value for the measure in that exact form from the following html table:

Know that the context where the table was mentioned is the following:

Performance evaluation of PerceptiveAgent. BERTScore (%) measures the quality of cognitive empathy in linguistic contents, while accuracy (%) assesses the quality of affective empathy in acoustic responses.

The table is referenced in the paper as follows:

Table 1 presents the overall performance of PerceptiveAgent on cognitive empathy and affective empathy, evaluated on the generated content and audio, respectively. BERTScore measures the semantic similarity between the generated and real response contents, while accuracy assesses the similarity and diversity of emotions between the generated and real speeches. Overall, compared to Speech-GPT3.5, PerceptiveAgent demonstrates a strong ability in generating empathetic responses with a closer alignment to the dialogue context in terms of linguistic content and a higher expressiveness in acoustic information. Specifically, PerceptiveAgent achieves a slightly higher BERTScore than Speech-GPT3.5, primarily because our model can generate content that more accurately captures the speaker’s intentions and contains more emotionally intense words. Additionally, PerceptiveAgent notably outperforms Speech-GPT3.5 in terms of accuracy, as the latter doesn’t incorporate any emotion prompts during speech generation, thus maintaining a limited variety of prosody. Despite this, the accuracy of PerceptiveAgent still remains at a relatively moderate level. This is because the generated responses, while contextually appropriate, may not entirely align with the real responses in terms of semantics and emotions. Effectiveness of Captions. The last line in Table 1 demonstrates the effectiveness of captions in PerceptiveAgent. The system without captions synthesizes speech using randomly selected labels for all four speaking attributes (pitch, speed, energy, and emotion), while maintaining the same response contents as the PerceptiveAgent. It is evident that the PerceptiveAgent outperforms the system without captions, highlighting the effectiveness of captions in generating speech with affective empathy.
