Consider the claims being in the form |{Specification, Specification, …}, Measure, Outcome|

Claims must be extracted according to the following format:
|{Specification, Specification, …}, Measure, Outcome|
Specification: |name, value| pair describing the details of an experiment
E.g.: |dataset, Spider|, or |LLM, Llama27b|
Measure: metric or measure used to evaluate the experiment
E.g.: F1-measure
Outcome: outcome value related to metric 
E.g.: 0.89

The format have to follows this examples:

Suppose the table is mentioned in this context:
Table 1.Benchmark Results of Execution Match of all Models we tested on the "dev" SPIDER dataset
In our experimentation, we organized the models into three distinct groups as illustrated in Table 1: general purpose LLMs, Code-Specific LLMs, and Sequence-to-Sequence models. Table 1 further presents the Execution Match score on the SPIDER dataset for each studied LLM and for each of the four difficulty levels. Note that for all LLMs, we run our experiments with both Type I and Type II prompts (cf. 4.5.2), and we always select best performance. The overall winner is the GPT-4 + DIN approach which emerged as the most effective choice across all General LLMs. Furthermore, when focusing on models with fewer than 7 billion parameters, ALPACA stood out as the top-performing option following prompt optimization.

So for the following html table:

The claims are:
Claim 0: |{|Model Type, General LLM|, |Model Name, ChatGPT-3.5-turbo|, |Parameter Size, 175B|, |Dataset, Spider dev|, |Difficulty Level, 1|}, Execution Match , 0.760|
Claim 1:| .... |

Extract all the claims presented in the table and its associated context (including references, captions, and footnotes) for the following html table. Use the provided references, captions, and footnotes to deduce the meanings of acronyms wherever possible. If the meanings are unclear or conflicting, include a note such as '[Unresolved]' instead of making assumptions. For fields that are missing or empty, include them with a placeholder such as 'N/A' while maintaining the exact format.
If multiple claims seem to refer to the same data point but differ slightly, include both claims and add a comment field noting the ambiguity.
Understand from the context the task that involve those measures and outcomes and put it as a specification in the claim, if it is not clear, put 'N/A' as the 'task' specification.

Know that the context where the table was mentioned is the following:
Performance evaluation of the speech captioner. Precision, recall and F1-score (%) are utilized to measure its generalization ability on both the validation and test sets. Predicted labels are obtained through semantic classification on the generated captions, while the true labels are derived from the TextroSpeech dataset.

The table is referenced in the paper as follows:
Table 2 evaluates the speech captioner's generalization performance on both the validation and test sets. Overall, it is evident that that the model achieves the highest F1-score for gender, followed by pitch and emotion. This underscores the model’s proficiency in accurately discerning these attributes from input speech. Besides, both gender and emotion exhibit closely aligned precision and recall metrics, affirming the model's predictive prowess for these attributes. Meanwhile, there exists a notable disparity between precision and recall when predicting energy, indicating variable performance and a tendency towards confident predictions. Conversely, the model’s performance in predicting speed is unsatisfactory, which can be attributed to the imbalanced distribution of speed in the training dataset, with over 60% of samples labeled as “neutral”.

Provide the results in a file in .txt format. And remember! To check if you did correct, there should be N claims where N is the number of numeric values in the table, and don't forget to don't put the metrics or measures in the specifications!
