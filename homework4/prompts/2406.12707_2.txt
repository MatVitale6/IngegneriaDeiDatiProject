Consider the claims being in the form |{Specification, Specification, …}, Measure, Outcome|

Claims must be extracted according to the following format:
|{Specification, Specification, …}, Measure, Outcome|
Specification: |name, value| pair describing the details of an experiment
E.g.: |dataset, Spider|, or |LLM, Llama27b|
Measure: metric or measure used to evaluate the experiment
E.g.: F1-measure
Outcome: outcome value related to metric 
E.g.: 0.89

The format have to follows this examples:
Claim 0: |{|Model Type, General LLM|, |Model Name, ChatGPT-3.5-turbo|, |Parameter Size, 175B|, |Dataset, Spider dev|, |Difficulty Level, 1|}, Execution Match , 0.760|
Claim 1:| .... |

Extract all the claims, even with empty value for the measure in that exact form from the following html table:

Know that the context where the table was mentioned is the following:

Performance evaluation of the speech captioner. Precision, recall and F1-score (%) are utilized to measure its generalization ability on both the validation and test sets. Predicted labels are obtained through semantic classification on the generated captions, while the true labels are derived from the TextroSpeech dataset.

The table is referenced in the paper as follows:

Table 2 evaluates the speech captioner's generalization performance on both the validation and test sets. Overall, it is evident that that the model achieves the highest F1-score for gender, followed by pitch and emotion. This underscores the model’s proficiency in accurately discerning these attributes from input speech. Besides, both gender and emotion exhibit closely aligned precision and recall metrics, affirming the model's predictive prowess for these attributes. Meanwhile, there exists a notable disparity between precision and recall when predicting energy, indicating variable performance and a tendency towards confident predictions. Conversely, the model’s performance in predicting speed is unsatisfactory, which can be attributed to the imbalanced distribution of speed in the training dataset, with over 60% of samples labeled as “neutral”.
