Consider the claims being in the form |{Specification, Specification, …}, Measure, Outcome|

Claims must be extracted according to the following format:
|{Specification, Specification, …}, Measure, Outcome|
Specification: |name, value| pair describing the details of an experiment
E.g.: |dataset, Spider|, or |LLM, Llama27b|
Measure: metric or measure used to evaluate the experiment
E.g.: F1-measure
Outcome: outcome value related to metric 
E.g.: 0.89

The format have to follows this examples:
Claim 0: |{|Model Type, General LLM|, |Model Name, ChatGPT-3.5-turbo|, |Parameter Size, 175B|, |Dataset, Spider dev|, |Difficulty Level, 1|}, Execution Match , 0.760|
Claim 1:| .... |

Extract all the claims, even with empty value for the measure in that exact form from the following html table:

<table border="1"> <thead> <tr> <th>Model</th> <th>Method</th> <th>EM score</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td rowspan="4">PaLM-540B</td> <td>CoT [61]</td> <td>29.4</td> </tr> <tr> <td>CoT-SC [55]</td> <td>33.4</td> </tr> <tr> <td>ReAct [65]</td> <td>27.4</td> </tr> <tr> <td>ReAct → CoT-SC</td> <td>35.1</td> </tr> <tr> <td>GPT3-175B</td> <td>ReAct</td> <td>30.8</td> </tr> <tr> <td rowspan="2">PaLM-62B</td> <td>ReAct-Tuning</td> <td>32.6</td> </tr> <tr> <td>CoT-Tuning</td> <td>25.2</td> </tr> <tr> <td rowspan="2">PaLM-8B</td> <td>ReAct-Tuning</td> <td>25.0</td> </tr> <tr> <td>CoT-Tuning</td> <td>14.1</td> </tr> <tr> <td rowspan="2">LLaMA-7B</td> <td>ReAct-Tuning</td> <td>28.1</td> </tr> <tr> <td>LTC</td> <td><b>33.2</b></td> </tr> </tbody></table>


Know that the context where the table was mentioned is the following:

AlfWorld success rates (%) for 6 tasks. The results of the bottom block are obtained by fine-tuning LLaMA-7B model.

The table is referenced in the paper as follows:

As shown in Table 1, LTC outperforms the previous best methods * * * For ALFWorld, ReAct and ReAct-IM results are from Table 3 of [65]. BUTLER and BUTLERg results are from Table 4 of [46], and they are trained with DAgger [ 38 ] . on all of tasks of ALFWorld . We can see that Instruction Fine-tuning is already a strong baseline outperforming others, yet our LTC achieves a success rate of 91%, remarkably outperforming the best Instruction Tuning baseline (78%).Notably, on both Cool and Look tasks, LTC obtains a 100% success rate.Even on the hardest Pick Two & Place task (e.g., “put two pencils in the drawer”), it achieves a decent 76% success rate.The Pick Two task requires the agent to perform two sequences of ”pick and place” actions in one task, while keeping track of the desired type and the location.The combined sequences and the need to remember the previous location make this task challenging.This may be the reason why baselines achieve lower success rates on this task.In contrast, our LTC agent, which further trains the agent with self-exploration significantly outperforms other agents. This underscores the effectiveness of the communication mechanism in LTC.
