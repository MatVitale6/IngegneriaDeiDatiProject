Consider the claims being in the form |{Specification, Specification, …}, Measure, Outcome|

Claims must be extracted according to the following format:
|{Specification, Specification, …}, Measure, Outcome|
Specification: |name, value| pair describing the details of an experiment
E.g.: |dataset, Spider|, or |LLM, Llama27b|
Measure: metric or measure used to evaluate the experiment
E.g.: F1-measure
Outcome: outcome value related to metric 
E.g.: 0.89

The format have to follows this examples:

Suppose the table is mentioned in this context:
Table 1.Benchmark Results of Execution Match of all Models we tested on the "dev" SPIDER dataset
In our experimentation, we organized the models into three distinct groups as illustrated in Table 1: general purpose LLMs, Code-Specific LLMs, and Sequence-to-Sequence models. Table 1 further presents the Execution Match score on the SPIDER dataset for each studied LLM and for each of the four difficulty levels. Note that for all LLMs, we run our experiments with both Type I and Type II prompts (cf. 4.5.2), and we always select best performance. The overall winner is the GPT-4 + DIN approach which emerged as the most effective choice across all General LLMs. Furthermore, when focusing on models with fewer than 7 billion parameters, ALPACA stood out as the top-performing option following prompt optimization.

So for the following html table:

The claims are:
Claim 0: |{|Model Type, General LLM|, |Model Name, ChatGPT-3.5-turbo|, |Parameter Size, 175B|, |Dataset, Spider dev|, |Difficulty Level, 1|}, Execution Match , 0.760|
Claim 1:| .... |

Extract all the claims presented in the table and its associated context (including references, captions, and footnotes) for the following html table. Use the provided references, captions, and footnotes to deduce the meanings of acronyms wherever possible. If the meanings are unclear or conflicting, include a note such as '[Unresolved]' instead of making assumptions. For fields that are missing or empty, include them with a placeholder such as 'N/A' while maintaining the exact format.
If multiple claims seem to refer to the same data point but differ slightly, include both claims and add a comment field noting the ambiguity.

Know that the context where the table was mentioned is the following:
Zero-shot task-solving performances under various prompts for three closed-source LLMs.

The table is referenced in the paper as follows:
We design two types of prompts combined with different levels of model description to test LLMs’ zero-shot performances. The first, Prompt-1, only combines the task description with the model names, while the second, Prompt-2, integrates the task description with comprehensive model descriptions, detailing model usage, input, and output types (additional information about these two prompts is provided in Fig. A.6 in supplementary).We analyze the results in Tab. 3 and 4 in conjunction with the previous zero-shot results in Tab. 1 and 2 . Compared to the original prompt that only uses task description to generate the results in Tab. 1 and 2 , it is evident that in most cases, the closed-source LLMs, such as GPT series and Claude-2, tend to outperform when provided with detailed model-related information as seen in Prompt-1 and Prompt-2. In contrast, open-source LLMs, whose understanding and reasoning capacity may be weaker than those huge closed-source models, appear to be misled by the ambiguous details in Prompt-1 and Prompt-2 during the model selection process.Overall, detailed prompts can assist in improving the zero-shot performance to a certain degree, depending on the specific model. However, they may not be as potent as other training scenarios for smaller size LLMs, such as fine-tuning or RLTF.

Provide the results in a file in .txt format. And remember! To check if you did correct, there should be N claims where N is the number of numeric values in the table.
