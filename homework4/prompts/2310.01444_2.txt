Consider the claims being in the form |{Specification, Specification, …}, Measure, Outcome|

Claims must be extracted according to the following format:
|{Specification, Specification, …}, Measure, Outcome|
Specification: |name, value| pair describing the details of an experiment
E.g.: |dataset, Spider|, or |LLM, Llama27b|
Measure: metric or measure used to evaluate the experiment
E.g.: F1-measure
Outcome: outcome value related to metric 
E.g.: 0.89

The format have to follows this examples:

Suppose the table is mentioned in this context:
Table 1.Benchmark Results of Execution Match of all Models we tested on the "dev" SPIDER dataset
In our experimentation, we organized the models into three distinct groups as illustrated in Table 1: general purpose LLMs, Code-Specific LLMs, and Sequence-to-Sequence models. Table 1 further presents the Execution Match score on the SPIDER dataset for each studied LLM and for each of the four difficulty levels. Note that for all LLMs, we run our experiments with both Type I and Type II prompts (cf. 4.5.2), and we always select best performance. The overall winner is the GPT-4 + DIN approach which emerged as the most effective choice across all General LLMs. Furthermore, when focusing on models with fewer than 7 billion parameters, ALPACA stood out as the top-performing option following prompt optimization.

So for the following html table:

The claims are:
Claim 0: |{|Model Type, General LLM|, |Model Name, ChatGPT-3.5-turbo|, |Parameter Size, 175B|, |Dataset, Spider dev|, |Difficulty Level, 1|}, Execution Match , 0.760|
Claim 1:| .... |

Extract all the claims presented in the table and its associated context (including references, captions, and footnotes) for the following html table. Use the provided references, captions, and footnotes to deduce the meanings of acronyms wherever possible. If the meanings are unclear or conflicting, include a note such as '[Unresolved]' instead of making assumptions. For fields that are missing or empty, include them with a placeholder such as 'N/A' while maintaining the exact format.
If multiple claims seem to refer to the same data point but differ slightly, include both claims and add a comment field noting the ambiguity.
Understand from the context the task that involve those measures and outcomes and put it as a specification in the claim, if it is not clear, put 'N/A' as the 'task' specification.

Know that the context where the table was mentioned is the following:
EM scores on HotpotQA with prompt and tuning methods. Methods that use fine-tuning are marked by “-Tuning”.

The table is referenced in the paper as follows:
As shown in Table 3, LTC outperforms the instruction tuning baseline† by 5.1% on Exact Match (EM) score, and it even outperforms ReAct and CoT on their default settings. Note that ReAct and CoT use PaLM-540B and GPT3-175B as the pre-trained LM model, which is 77x and 25x larger than our the LLaMA-7B model we used. By sampling 21 CoT trajectories during inference and adopting the majority answer, CoT-SC is slightly better (0.2%) than LTC, and their combined method ReAct → CoT-SC surpasses LTC by 1.9%. Compared to other models with tuning, our LLaMA-7B based agent even obtains slightly better (0.6%) performance than the ReAct-Tuning baseline with 9* larger PaLM-62B model.

Provide the results in a file in .txt format. And remember! To check if you did correct, there should be N claims where N is the number of numeric values in the table, and don't forget to don't put the metrics or measures in the specifications!
