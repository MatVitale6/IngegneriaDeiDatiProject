Consider the claims being in the form |{Specification, Specification, …}, Measure, Outcome|

Claims must be extracted according to the following format:
|{Specification, Specification, …}, Measure, Outcome|
Specification: |name, value| pair describing the details of an experiment
E.g.: |dataset, Spider|, or |LLM, Llama27b|
Measure: metric or measure used to evaluate the experiment
E.g.: F1-measure
Outcome: outcome value related to metric 
E.g.: 0.89

The format have to follows this examples:
Claim 0: |{|Model Type, General LLM|, |Model Name, ChatGPT-3.5-turbo|, |Parameter Size, 175B|, |Dataset, Spider dev|, |Difficulty Level, 1|}, Execution Match , 0.760|
Claim 1:| .... |

Extract all the claims, even with empty value for the measure in that exact form from the following html table:

<table border="1"> <thead> <tr> <th>Model</th> <th>Method</th> <th>EM score</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td rowspan="4">PaLM-540B</td> <td>CoT [61]</td> <td>29.4</td> </tr> <tr> <td>CoT-SC [55]</td> <td>33.4</td> </tr> <tr> <td>ReAct [65]</td> <td>27.4</td> </tr> <tr> <td>ReAct → CoT-SC</td> <td>35.1</td> </tr> <tr> <td>GPT3-175B</td> <td>ReAct</td> <td>30.8</td> </tr> <tr> <td rowspan="2">PaLM-62B</td> <td>ReAct-Tuning</td> <td>32.6</td> </tr> <tr> <td>CoT-Tuning</td> <td>25.2</td> </tr> <tr> <td rowspan="2">PaLM-8B</td> <td>ReAct-Tuning</td> <td>25.0</td> </tr> <tr> <td>CoT-Tuning</td> <td>14.1</td> </tr> <tr> <td rowspan="2">LLaMA-7B</td> <td>ReAct-Tuning</td> <td>28.1</td> </tr> <tr> <td>LTC</td> <td><b>33.2</b></td> </tr> </tbody></table>
