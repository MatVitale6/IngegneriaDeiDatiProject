Consider the claims being in the form |{Specification, Specification, …}, Measure, Outcome|

Claims must be extracted according to the following format:
|{Specification, Specification, …}, Measure, Outcome|
Specification: |name, value| pair describing the details of an experiment
E.g.: |dataset, Spider|, or |LLM, Llama27b|
Measure: metric or measure used to evaluate the experiment
E.g.: F1-measure
Outcome: outcome value related to metric 
E.g.: 0.89

The format have to follows this examples:

Suppose the table is mentioned in this context:
Table 1.Benchmark Results of Execution Match of all Models we tested on the "dev" SPIDER dataset
In our experimentation, we organized the models into three distinct groups as illustrated in Table 1: general purpose LLMs, Code-Specific LLMs, and Sequence-to-Sequence models. Table 1 further presents the Execution Match score on the SPIDER dataset for each studied LLM and for each of the four difficulty levels. Note that for all LLMs, we run our experiments with both Type I and Type II prompts (cf. 4.5.2), and we always select best performance. The overall winner is the GPT-4 + DIN approach which emerged as the most effective choice across all General LLMs. Furthermore, when focusing on models with fewer than 7 billion parameters, ALPACA stood out as the top-performing option following prompt optimization.

So for the following html table:

The claims are:
Claim 0: |{|Model Type, General LLM|, |Model Name, ChatGPT-3.5-turbo|, |Parameter Size, 175B|, |Dataset, Spider dev|, |Difficulty Level, 1|}, Execution Match , 0.760|
Claim 1:| .... |

Extract all the claims presented in the table and its associated context (including references, captions, and footnotes) for the following html table. Use the provided references, captions, and footnotes to deduce the meanings of acronyms wherever possible. If the meanings are unclear or conflicting, include a note such as '[Unresolved]' instead of making assumptions. For fields that are missing or empty, include them with a placeholder such as 'N/A' while maintaining the exact format.
If multiple claims seem to refer to the same data point but differ slightly, include both claims and add a comment field noting the ambiguity.
Understand from the context the task that involve those measures and outcomes and put it as a specification in the claim, if it is not clear, put 'N/A' as the 'task' specification.

Know that the context where the table was mentioned is the following:
Comparison of FPR of multi-agent defense using LLaMA-2-7b introducing Llama Guard as a agent.

The table is referenced in the paper as follows:
Custom agent: Llama Guard as an agent in defense. The FPR of the multi-agent defense configurations based on LLaMA-2-7b is relatively high.To tackle this problem, we introduce Llama Guard Inan et al. ( 2023 ) as an additional defense agent to form a 4-agent system.Table 3 shows that LLama Guard performs best when both prompt and response are provided.The prompt inferred by the prompt analyzer can be used as the input of the Llama Guard.So we let the Llama Guard agent generate its response after the prompt analyzer agent.The Llama Guard agent extracts the possible prompts from the prompt analyzer’s response, combines them with the given response to form multiple pairs, and uses these prompt-response pairs to infer with Llama Guard.If none of the prompt-response pairs get an unsafe output from Llama Guard, the Llama Guard agent will respond that the given response is safe.The judge agent will consider the response from the LLama Guard agent and other agents to form its judgment.Table 4 demonstrates that the FPR significantly decreased after introducing Llama Guard as an agent, and the ASR remains at a low level.This encouraging result suggests AutoDefense is flexible to integrate different defense methods as additional agents, where the multi-agent defense system benefits from new capabilities of new agents.

Provide the results in a file in .txt format. And remember! To check if you did correct, there should be N claims where N is the number of numeric values in the table, and don't forget to don't put the metrics or measures in the specifications!
